While all Pacific salmon species are prohibited in groundfish trawl and cannot
be sold or traded, salmon bycatch in trawl fisheries experience high mortality
rates and there have been no management measures in place to monitor or
mitigate risks to stocks of concern. This sampling program was designed in
collaboration between DFO Science, Fisheries Management, industry and
monitoring service providers to provide accurate estimates of salmon bycatch
by species in the trawl fishery and representative information on Chinook
stock composition and indicator stocks.

Initial discussions led to the following four objectives being adopted to
guide development of the program: 1\. Accurately estimate the catch in numbers
of fish of each salmon species; 2\. Ensure sufficiently accurate and
representative CWT sampling to quantify the fishery mortality for Chinook
indicator stocks; 3\. Use genetic stock identification (i.e. DNA) where
feasible to identify the stock composition of Chinook catch, including for
populations that do not have CWT indicator stocks; and 4\. Estimate the
spatial and temporal distribution of Chinook catch to determine when and where
exploitation on stocks of concern may be occurring.

The program was initiated across for all option A groundfish trawl vessels in
September 2022, and will be continued during the 2023/24 fiscal year.

targets for Pacific salmon by pairing Indigenous knowledge systems with
Western science within a knowledge co-production paradigm. Knowledge co-
production can be defined as “the process of bringing together two different
knowledge systems, in true partnership and equity, to enhance, learn, and
create new understandings on a specific topic.” (Ellam Yua et al. 2022).

Analytical methods for identifying limit reference points have been developed
for Pacific salmon (DFO 2022a) based on Western science, but these have not
considered Indigenous Knowledge which was identified as a gap within CSAS
review (DFO 2022a, b). ‘Upper stock references’ (delineating ‘critical’ and
‘cautious’ zones of status) and rebuilding targets are components of the DFO’s
Precautionary Approach Framework and the Fish Stocks provisions under the
Fisheries Act, but guidance on identifying them is currently lacking for
Pacific salmon. The Fisheries Act further enables the consideration of
Indigenous Knowledge in management, such as in the development of rebuilding
targets and reference points, but there is limited/no precedents for this for
Pacific salmon.

Pairing Indigenous knowledge systems and Western science in the development of
reference points and targets is a step towards ensuring that rebuilding is
inclusive of Nations’ ontologies, including their definitions for ‘healthy’
and ‘rebuilt’. First Nations have a precedence of knowledge that includes
generations of place-based observations that cannot be recreated, or
necessarily measured quantitatively. This project, partnered with the Ha’oom
Fisheries Society, will explore how to include this alongside or within
Western science ideas of status assessment and rebuilding. Methods will be co-
created with First Nations partners; we anticipate that they will include a
combination of interviews, facilitated discussions, literature reviews, and
meta-analyses. In particular, we will identify what levels and attributes are
considered ‘healthy’ or ‘rebuilt’ for salmon populations and where ‘serious
harm’ is expected to occur, including life-history, distributional, and
habitat characteristics.

The project will be co-led with the Five Nations (Ahousaht, Ehattesaht,
Mowachaht/Muchalaht, Hesquiaht and Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations) that are
represented by the Ha’oom Fisheries Society, with a focus on relationship
building and addressing Indigenous needs and values. Bringing Indigenous
knowledge systems and Western science together will lead to more equitable and
inclusive outcomes, supporting the aims of reconciliation and furthering the
capacity for Indigenous self governance. Achieving sustainability of salmon
fisheries cannot be achieved through a Western scientific lens alone;
incorporating Indigenous Knowledge Systems and a broader perspective on what
is considered healthy and serious harm in salmon ecosystems will be essential.
The costs in year 1 will be supported in part by Five Nations Funding through
DFO’s Treaties and Reconciliation Agreements Program.

West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschwatcha) populations declined precipitously after the 1990s. Survival rates for naturally spawning WCVI Chinook are now below replacement levels. In 2020, WCVI Chinook was listed as ""Threatened"" by Canada's Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife triggering the Chinook Rebuilding Plan and the marine and freshwater risk assessment (FWRA) processes. Results from the FWRA, highlighted that across the region the incubation life history phase was extremely data deficient. High incubation mortality can reduce productivity and limit the recovery of Chinook salmon populations. A small change in survival during this life history phase can have significant implications on production. Redd scour was identified as a high priority data gap in the indicator watersheds throughout WCVI. The purpose of this study is to evaluate redd scour, sediment transport, and hydrological conditions in three indicator watersheds in Area 23 and Area 24. This study will be important for developing a standard methodology to address this data gap, and for characterizing the scale of the issue. The results will be vital for developing indicators and benchmarks, and to inform restoration, enhancement, and rebuilding measures for WCVI Chinook.

  2. The outcomes of the redd scour study are to: A. Develop a robust methodology to measure redd scour that can be repeated in indicator watersheds across the region; B. Estimate what percentage of redds are scoured at different flow thresholds and how that impacts salmonid mortality during incubation; and, C. Understand what effect more frequent and higher peak flows in a changing climate will have on redd scour and salmonid mortality in the future.

The methodology for the study has three components: I. The installation of a
hydrometric station that is calibrated to provide a continuous discharge
record for Tranquil Creek and implement a pilot methodology in Tranquil Creek
(completed 2022). II. Field surveys in spawning locations that includes cross-
sections and sediment size measurements, and the installation of PIT tagged
accelerometer scour chains at surveyed locations to measure redd scour;
(planned for Sarita [externally funded] and Tranquil in 2023 and Bedwell
2024). III. Pairing bed disturbance data with a 2D hydraulic model to estimate
the spatial extent of bed disturbance at a reach scale in key Chinook and chum
spawning areas. (Planned for 2023 in Sarita [externally funded] and 2024
Bedwell).

  1. The results from this study will be important for characterizing the scale of the issue and will be vital for developing restoration prescriptions and can inform indicator development, enhancement, and rebuilding strategies in the region. In particular, for the Bedwell and Sarita Rivers, a rotary screw trap provides a total abundance estimate, which facilities that calculation of the egg-fry survival rate. Developing a relationship between over-winter egg-fry survival and redd scour and sediment movement, will be important for understanding the scale of the issue in watersheds across WVCI and the urgency needed to address this issue.

Hyatt et al. developed the Risk Assessment Method for Salmon (RAMS) in 2010 to
identify and prioritize factors that limit salmon production, both now and
under climate change. It was adapted from existing DFO risk assessment
frameworks and a risk assessment framework for fisheries in Australia, and
provides a standardized and semi-quantitative method to integrate ecosystem
data and expert opinion related to salmon survival across all their life
stages. The resulting list of ranked risks identifies both high priority
management needs and data gaps that require additional investigation.

RAMS has been applied in more than a half dozen watersheds for Chinook (ocean
and stream type), coho, and sockeye to inform Recovery Potential Assessments
under the Species at Risk Act and Rebuilding Plans under the Fish Stock
Provisions of the Fisheries Act. RAMS continues to evolve toward a standard
methodology flexible enough to assess risks at different scales and with
various levels of data availability. Included in those methods are: Regional
Salmon Information Tables that provide scientific information about freshwater
limiting factors for all major life history strategies of Pacific salmon
species; a deterministic Life History Model template completed using relevant
population data; an Ecosystem (Habitat) Status Report template completed using
existing habitat and ecosystem information; and a Risk Assessment Matrix
template completed during a RAMS workshop, currently in Excel format.

Areas of improvement for RAMS have been identified to facilitate regional
implementation. Several components will be addressed by the existing project
team, but some are beyond the capacity and/or expertise of the team and are
the purpose of this proposed work. These include: (A) updates to the Regional
Salmon Information Tables. This resource has not been updated since inception
and significant new science is available to maintain relevance. Inclusion of
marine information is also necessary to understand the bottlenecks to salmon
across all their life stages. And (B) a conversion from the Excel-based Risk
Assessment Matrix template to an R program based on a relational database with
an interactive user interface. The Excel-based template is functional but does
not allow for visualization of the many ecosystem components that are
aggregated to understand risk; complex analysis of relationships between
indicators and limiting factors; or hierarchical meta-analyses of data gaps
and risk across stocks to facilitate prioritization of monitoring and
research. Conversion to a relational database with a user interface will allow
for this functionality.

**(2) OUTCOMES:**

A updated, robust RAMS framework applicable for all salmon species structured
for continuous learning and updating, that is user-friendly for DFO and non-
DFO technical staff. Specifically, 1\. Updated Regional Salmon Information
Tables by life stage and ecosystem unit, including indicators, benchmarks, and
guidance for RAMS facilitators. Request is for two BI-02s to update through
existing literature and engage with DFO and other scientists (e.g., Dr.
Jonathon Moore’s lab at SFU, Institute of Ocean Sciences oceanographers) to
facilitate addition of freshwater and marine indicators and information. The
team will pilot the tables for use in rebuilding and recovery processes and
update as needed. 2\. Updated Risk Assessment Matrix template from Excel to an
R-based program and backend database. This will require specialized coding
expertise either through hiring or contract.  
3\. Workshop(s) with relevant DFO staff will be used to scope the structure
and functionality required. 4\. Updates to the RAMS methodology and support
work will require 0.35 FTE (Full Time Equivalents) for a BI-03.

**(3) THE MANAGEMENT QUESTION(S) ADDRESSED**

RAMS will prioritize risks to salmon stocks across the 3 Hs of Habitat,
Harvest, and Hatcheries by identifying management and mitigation options most
likely to result in successful restoration and rebuilding, which will support
decision making in each of the 3Hs. It will prioritize scientific research and
monitoring to address key knowledge gaps and integrate knowledge across
disciplines inside and outside DFO. RAMS will support and standardize the
legislated requirements for rebuilding plans under the Fish Stock Provisions
and Recovery Potential Assessments under SARA.

infected brood females using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with
a predetermined positive-negative threshold optical density value. The current
guidelines for control of BKD have significantly reduced the incidence of

IHNV prevalence in sockeye salmon stocks in British Columbia remain
unresolved. Understanding the drivers behind the occurrence and perpetuation

patterns of IHNV occurrence across Fraser, Skeena and Columbia River Sockeye
salmon stocks with the goal of identifying the factors which influence IHNV
infection and disease in BC Sockeye salmon stocks. This will be achieved
through three main objectives accomplished over a two year period: Objective
1: (Year 1) – Expand upon a long-term dataset of IHNV in Fraser and Skeena
Sockeye stocks to include IHNV monitoring results of Okanagan River Sockeye
salmon. In addition this comprehensive IHNV dataset will be populated with
data detailing the enumeration of fish at various life stages, survival rates,
and productivity for each of the corresponding Sockeye stocks. Where
available, data concerning environmental and other potentially important

database to explore how these variables may impact pathogen prevalence.

Objective 2: (Year 1&amp; 2) – Data verification and analyses to compare IHNV
prevalence across the multiple Sockeye salmon stocks, evaluating similarities

decades culminating in four of the lowest returns on record in 2020-2023.
These declines have put immense strain on the subsistence communities and Fish
Nations that historically depended upon Chinook salmon throughout the Yukon
River. They have also impacted the ability of the United States and Canada to
meet escapement goals under the Pacific Salmon Treaty’s Yukon River Agreement,
and are likely to have resulted in the Stock Management Unit, which is
scheduled to be prescribed by regulation under the amended Fisheries Act in
2023/2024, to fall below its Limit Reference Point. In recent years large
numbers (33%-52%) of returning Canadian-origin Chinook salmon have gone
“missing” between sonar assessments at the mouth of the Yukon River and ~2000
km upriver at the border between Alaska and Canada. This has severely
undermined the efficacy of fisheries management measures within the Alaskan
portion of the river. A leading hypothesis for these missing fish is en route
mortality due to heat stress (JTC 2020), which has been documented along with
opportunistic observation of premature mortalities in Yukon River Chinook
Salmon when spawning migration water temperatures exceed 18°C (Biela et al.
2020; 2022). However, direct estimates of en route mortality do not exist and
a recent CSAS regional peer review (DFO 2022) identified the drivers and
magnitude of en route mortality, and their consequences for management advice,
as a critical uncertainty.

We propose to carry out a 3 year radio-telemetry project to quantify en route
mortality of Yukon Chinook in relation to freshwater environmental conditions
along their up to ~3000km migration from the mouth of the Yukon river to
headwater spawning grounds. We will then use these estimates of en route
mortality to evaluate the sustainability of the current aggregate escapement
goal for Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook, and rebuilding potential of component
Conservation Units (Connors et al. 2022) to inform analyses to meet the Fish
Stock Provisions of the revised Fisheries Act for the Stock Management Unit.
We are specifically seeking funding to extend radio-tracking infrastructure
(towers and aerial overflights) into Canada to take advantage of an Alaska
Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G) project that will tag and track ~600
Chinook salmon in the Alaskan Portion of the Yukon River.

The management question being addressed by this project is: what is the
magnitude of en route mortality in Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook and what are
its consequences for international and domestic fisheries management,
rebuilding potential, and integrated planning.

The specific outcomes of this project include:

  1. estimates of migration speed, timing, and en route mortality of Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook, by Conservation Unit and river section, in relation to freshwater environmental conditions; and

  2. quantitative evaluation of the consequences of a range of en route mortality (based on study) for the sustainability of alternative aggregate escapement goals and rebuilding potential.

Renfrew, BC) that supports distinct populations of Chinook, Coho and Chum,
with Chinook enhanced annually at the 4 Mile Hatchery. Although logging
throughout the watershed has resulted in considerable gravel deposition and
bank erosion along the spawning reaches of the river, there is still an
extensive intact estuary connecting the San Juan and Gordon Rivers that
provides valuable rearing habitat for juvenile salmon. The San Juan River
empties into Port San Juan (PFMA 20-2).

Pacheedaht First Nation’s Salmon Stewardship Program conducts monitoring and
restoration work in and around the San Juan-Gordon watersheds to mitigate
logging effects and rebuild salmon stocks. Their monitoring work spans the
salmon lifecycle and includes investigating impacts of redd scour on egg-to-
fry survival, documenting juvenile salmon habitat use in the estuary, and
conducting adult spawner surveys. Recently, they have also launched a pilot
Chinook mass-marking program with the 4 Mile Hatchery to reduce the impacts of
hatchery genetics on the wild Chinook population through selective removals of
adipose-clipped Chinook in terminal fisheries (community/FSC, and potentially
sport).

These activities all inform the San Juan Chinook Rebuilding Plan currently in
development by Pacheedaht, which will feed into the broader WCVI Chinook
Rebuilding Plan in development by DFO (required under the Fish Stock
Provisions Act for naturally-produced WCVI Chinook, due March 2024) (DFO 2022;
Minister of Justice 2022). However, the recent WCVI Chinook Risk Assessment
process identified several knowledge gaps, mostly related to early freshwater
and marine life cycle stages. For San Juan Chinook specifically, juvenile data
from these life stages (and interactions between hatchery and wild juveniles)
are sparse, and spawner abundance data are limited in scope not only for
Chinook, but also Coho and Chum.

These reasons make the San Juan River a good candidate to develop an
integrated life history monitoring program in alignment with the larger Follow
The Fish program. We propose to continue work initiated in 2022-2023 that
collected data across four life stages of San Juan Chinook, thus complementing
Pacheedaht’s established programs. First, we will implement a rotary screw
trap to intercept naturally-produced out-migrating juveniles (all species, but
focused on spring juvenile Chinook migration timing), allowing us to compare
natural migration timing to hatchery release timing and to gather baseline
biological traits relative to hatchery releases (e.g., size, condition). If
funding and resources permit, a feasibility mark-recapture to obtain a
relative abundance estimate for naturally-produced juvenile Chinook will be
implemented. Second, we will conduct biweekly purse seining in Port San Juan
during summer months (~May-August) to collect mixed-stock information,
including hatchery/natural-origin of juvenile Chinook, stock ID, biological
traits, environmental stress responses (through gill clips), relative
abundance, and information on other species schooling with Chinook (e.g.,
Coho, Pacific Herring). Third, we will continue winter microtrolling work in
Port San Juan that began in 2021 as part of the Follow The Fish project, which
will collect detailed biological information (similar to purse seining data)
on overwintering juvenile Chinook and Coho. We will also calibrate
microtrolling and purse seining methods through simultaneous sampling events.
Fourth, we will deploy a Garmin LiveScope hydroacoustic fish-finder in the San
Juan River to enumerate early, mid and late run salmon. Pairing the LiveScope
with species composition data from the 4 Mile Hatchery fence and snorkel
surveys will allow us to compare methods and potentially calibrate escapement
estimates. Most of Pacheedaht’s community/Food, Social and Ceremonial (FSC)
salmon harvest is directed at Coho due to prolonged low returns of Chinook;
improved adult Coho enumeration (Late-run Coho in particular) has been
identified by Pacheedaht as critical in order to sustainably manage their
community Coho fishery.

We focus on Chinook due to the reasons mentioned previously (e.g., Rebuilding
Plans) and for linkages to other programs currently funded under PSSI Pillar
1.1 such as Follow The Fish (DM Apps Project ID 2407) and Ecological
Indicators (DM Apps Project ID 2414). Our budget reflects costs for expanding
feasibility studies in Year 1 (2022-2023), including technician time to
support not only San Juan work but also Ecological Indicators and occasionally
Follow The Fish (we plan to share technician resources among all projects as
much as possible). However, our work will also provide data on other salmon
species in the San Juan watershed of interest to DFO and Pacheedaht.
Pacheedaht employ a team of highly skilled technicians and biologists, and are
well placed to eventually lead much of this work in future, following a brief
period of investment, capacity building, and project development supported by
DFO.

needed for the development/improvement of weather stations and the maintenance
of the weather station network (their data are crucial for forcing the surface
of coastal ocean models), as well as for support with mooring
deployment/servicing and opportunistic CTD sampling (e.g., while servicing
weather stations). Furthermore, the EG4 will be needed to manage the inflow of
data from the Clayoquot Sound Monitoring Program.

Management questions: Near-surface hypoxia (as shallow as 12 m) has been
recently identified in Herbert Inlet, Clayoquot Sound (Rosen et al., 2022,
doi:10.3389/fmars.2022.1000041). The historical record in the region is
sparse, but it suggests that shallow hypoxia is found occasionally in this
inlet. Are salmon runs affected by low-oxygen conditions near the surface in
the fjords? Do these shallow hypoxic events constrain/restrict salmon habitat
during their migration? Are these shallow hypoxic events increasing in
frequency or can they be predicted in any way? (e.g., more common during
marine heat waves or during positive/negative ENSO years, etc.). In order to
address these questions, as well as the more generic question “What is the
environment that salmon encounter during their migration into and out of the
rivers, i.e. while they swim through fjords?”, we need to establish a
monitoring program throughout the fjords of interest. A consistent sampling
program in the next few years will create the baseline from which we will be
able to assess future changes; and a monitoring program that continues in the
future will make sure we can identify any climate-related change in the
fjords’ environment. Furthermore, by combining observations and high-
resolution (tens of meters) ocean models, we will be able to understand the
mechanisms that drive oxygen (and other – e.g., acidification) conditions in
the inlets, and predict how these will be impacted by a changing climate. The
modelling work proposed here for the WCVI will allow for the first study of
the impacts of future conditions in these fjords.

heavily impacted by climate change. These impacts are, however, expected to
vary in space and time as well as across species and life stages. As a result,
quantifying stock-specific risks of environmental change is critical for
prioritizing DFO management actions. We propose to develop a data-driven
analytical framework to quantify functional responses to climate variables
across the salmon life cycle and make projections for how stocks will respond
to climate change. Our approach will be sufficiently flexible to incorporate
information from stocks that span a broad range of data quality.

Our multi-year proposal involves two components: In component 1, we will pair
existing data on Pacific salmon population dynamics with readily available
freshwater and marine environmental data to estimate the effect of variables
such as temperature, flow, and food availability on salmon productivity (e.g.
recruits per spawner). We will quantify life stage-specific effects on
survival for stocks, including those with estimates of both juvenile and adult
abundance. The focal stocks for initial modeling of data-rich stocks will be
determined in year 1, with the goal of including stocks representing different
species, geographic areas and status assessments relative to Wild Salmon
Policy benchmarks. Ultimately, we will develop a hierarchical modeling
framework which will allow us to leverage relationships in data-rich systems
to estimate effects on data-limited stocks. In component 2, we will couple
this modelling framework with downscaled climate models to project stock-
specific responses under future climate scenarios. The projected biological
status of different stocks, and associated uncertainty in them, will provide a
scientifically defensible foundation upon which management interventions can
be prioritized.

We are requesting funds to hire two term Research Scientists to develop the
modelling framework. We expect that if only one RES were funded (or one RES
and a BI2) that they could develop an initial model and demonstrate its
application to a small number of case studies. However, to achieve the goal of
developing a data-driven framework that is ready to be applied to stocks
throughout the Pacific region, including those with medium or low data
availability, two RES positions are necessary. Although the two researchers
would work collaboratively, one position is focused on fitting models to
estimate functional relationships for data-rich stock while the other will use
simulations to develop methods for leveraging information from data-rich
stocks to data-poor and provide decision criteria for broader implementation.

provide urgently needed information for effective conservation and rebuilding
of West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook salmon populations. WCVI
Chinook are listed under bill C-68 and are threatened by local extinction and
poor marine survival, with high mortality thought to occur during the early
marine phase. Through the recent multi-stakeholder WCVI Chinook Salmon Marine
Risk Assessment (MRA) process multiple data gaps were identified for potential
factors that contribute to poor early marine survival. Many salmon surveys
have been conducted over the years, but few have been able to access shallower
areas within the sounds off the West Coast, where ocean-type Chinook may
reside for up to their first year at sea. Characterizing environmental
variables of these nearshore ecosystems in addition to the health and
condition of residing Chinook salmon is critical to understanding which
factors may be limiting survival. To address data gaps, in 2020 a highly
collaborative assessment program in nearshore areas within Sounds on the WCVI
was piloted to capture juvenile Chinook salmon in their first winter at sea
using microtrolling technology. Building on the successful implementation and
collaboration in this program, FtF aims to expand the assessment and
monitoring of WCVI Chinook both spatially and temporally to track fish
throughout their first year of life and identify limiting factors related to
growth and size-specific survival. The FtF program will focus on assessing
Chinook salmon originating from Stamp River, Sarita River and Nitinat River
populations in Barkley Sound as indicators of WCVI Chinook. Stamp River is an
existing indicator for WCVI Chinook, and existing programs and infrastructure
can enable relatively high rates of juvenile captures across the early marine
phase. Previous microtrolling efforts have demonstrated these populations are
detected in nearshore areas throughout WCVI Sounds over the winter through
capture of hatchery and wild fish. Although these populations are
predominately hatchery origin fish, contrasts will be made, where possible,
between wild and hatchery fish to understand how factors limiting survival and
growth may differ. Salmon will be captured at multiple time points throughout
their life cycle including in the Nitinat River Hatchery and Robertson Creek
Hatchery, in-river (rotary screw trap and/or beach seining), in estuary (beach
seining/purse seining), and in nearshore marine environments (purse
seining/microtrolling). At each time point, individual fish will be sampled to
assess health and condition (infectious agents, Fit-Chip gene expression
profiles, stomach contents, contaminants, lengths, weights, and clinical
signs) and stock of origin, paired with environmental data including physical
oceanography (temperature, oxygen, pH salinity, fluorescence) and biological
oceanography (chlorophyl, zooplankton). Scale samples from individual fish
will be used to compare relative rates of growth, based on circulus spacing,
across life stages and populations to assess the impact of health, condition
and environmental factors. Otolith samples taken concurrently will be used to
assess relative size-specific survival across time points and populations.
This can be achieved by characterizing the fork length to otolith radius
relationship for smolts at ocean entry and then using otolith microchemistry
for individuals who survive to subsequent time points. Broad distributional
trends in how WCVI Chinook migrate will be investigated with microtrolling by
capturing Northward migrating Barkley origin fish in Clayoquot, Nootka,
Kyuquot and Quatsino Sound. Chinook intercepted during microtrolling that are
not of Sarita, Stamp or Nitinat origin will be similarly sampled for
comparisons. Many current departmental research programs are collecting
datasets on salmon populations and their ecosystems that can be incorporated
into the FtF program for a comprehensive assessment of factors limiting
survival of WCVI Chinook. FtF is in discussion and working alongside both
internal and external collaborators to ensure datasets are integrated into FtF
(see project linkages). Existing DFO datasets from researchers across branches
will be synthesized alongside relevant datasets produced by external
collaborators. Throughout our FtF project timeline, we aim to incorporate
relevant datasets through new collaborations and outreach. This approach will
highlight data gaps that are not currently being addressed through either
departmental or external research groups and future research avenues. Data
outputs from this program will directly contribute to the WCVI Chinook
rebuilding plans and will be distributed across to project collaborators for
use in their programs. Knowledge on differential size-specific survival both
across the early marine phase and between wild and hatchery stocks will have
impacts on SEP management decisions for hatcheries and may inform harvest
strategies for WCVI Chinook populations. Characterizing differential growth
across the early marine phase will have important implications for restoration
activities (e.g., limited prey availability) and stock management e.g.,
(mitigating impacts on periods and areas of critical growth). Overall, data
outputs can be incorporated into pre-season and in-season forecasting and
other WCVI Chinook models.

reference points for decades despite large reductions in exploitation rates. A
common paradigm is that poor marine survival has constrained recovery;
however, the mechanisms (e.g. predation vs. starvation) leading to mortality
and at which life stages they operate remain unclear. One specific hypothesis
is that large aggregations of Steller sea lions intercept Fraser River sockeye
salmon (10 of 24 CUs threatened or endangered (COSEWIC 2017)) north of
Vancouver Island during return migrations. Yet little is known about sea lion
foraging behaviour and diet in these remote transitions zones between offshore
and coastal areas and even less is known about salmon mortality rates. Our
proposal outlines a field program to addresses salmon and pinniped components
simultaneously. This work will employ leading edge technologies to generate
hard data on sources of salmon mortality and specifically the degree of
pinniped mortality, moving us/debate/issue beyond the realm of conjecture and
inference. Although this document describes a sockeye salmon-sea lion field
program, we emphasize that our proposal is modular in that one or both species
components can be pursued, and the framework could focus on alternative
pinniped species, salmon species or salmon life stages based on departmental
priorities (e.g. harbor seal impacts on juvenile Chinook salmon); however the
costs associated with tagging juvenile salmonids will be considerably higher.

We will estimate sea lion predation on adult sockeye salmon as they migrate
past Triangle Island, off the northern tip of Vancouver Island. This region is
the site of the largest Steller sea lion rookery in the world and is
hypothesized to be a survival bottleneck that disproportionately impacts
Fraser River sockeye salmon productivity (e.g. Walters et al. 2020). Salmon-
related work would quantify predation impacts via multiple complementary
tagging technologies. After capturing sockeye salmon via purse seine near
Haida Gwaii, we will use satellite tags to quantify guild-specific predation
rates (e.g. cetacean, pinniped, shark) based on depth and temperature sensors,
to generate high resolution estimates of salmon habitat use, and to estimate
diversion rates that may moderate predation impacts (i.e. migrations through
Juan de Fuca rather than Johnstone Strait). We will leverage existing acoustic
telemetry infrastructure in the northern Strait of Georgia, that will increase
the precision of mortality rate estimates at relatively low cost. Pinniped-
related work will include complementary methods (fatty acids, stable isotopes
and scats) to estimate diets at multiple temporal scales along migration
pathways on either side of Vancouver Island. Pinniped diet analyses will be
complemented by satellite tagging to understand movements, distribution and
foraging behaviour in relation to salmon mortality locations. We wish to
emphasize that these pinniped data will be highly relevant for gauging
predator impacts more broadly, Including other PSSI initiatives.

For the salmon component, Y1 (FY 2023-24) will be a ramp-up period, with
tagging occurring in Y2 and Y3. For the pinniped component, diet collections
will begin in Y1 and continue through Y3. We will undertake initial satellite
tagging of pinnipeds in Y1 to refine effective protocols and increase tagging
rates in Y2 and Y3. Analytical pipelines for both components will be developed
in Y2 so that final analyses can begin in Y3 and continue through 2026 (PIs
have the capacity to complete analytical work without additional staffing).
Unfortunately salmon tagging will occur during off cycle years; however we
anticipate sufficient numbers of fish will be available to meet our sample
size requirements.

Ultimately data on survival rates and predation are critical to several
management questions. First, total survival rates can provide strategic
information on whether specific life history stages are likely to constrain
recovery (i.e. if survival is high then subsequent efforts should focus on
other stages). Second, information on guild-specific predation rates can
provide information on the utility of targeted management actions (e.g.
fisheries, culls). These data are also key inputs to ongoing life cycle and
ecosystem modeling efforts intended to guide prioritization of Pacific salmon
stocks for rebuilding.

salmon management and policy, the threat posed by AIS has largely been
ignored. Further, stressors like increasing global temperatures are out of the
control of regional management while AIS can be managed locally. By targeting
AIS most likely to have the biggest impact on salmon survival or productivity,
we can improve salmon recovery by reducing the stress that these invasive
species cause. AIS impacts on salmon are well documented in the US Pacific
Northwest where, for example, invasive Walleye consume up to 2 million smolts
a year in the Columbia River (Sanderson et al. 2009). The expansion of
Northern Pike in Alaska has led to the decline of salmon productivity in some
regions and all five salmon species have been classified as highly vulnerable
to pike invasion in at least part of their Alaskan range (Jalbert et al.
2021). Habitat alteration can also impact salmon: Schwoerer et al. (2019)
estimated the potential for $159 million annual damage to the Alaskan Sockeye
salmon industry from one invasive plant species, Elodea. However, the extent
and relative impact of freshwater AIS threats to salmon habitat and

upwelling events (i.e. movement of waters, often acidified, from depth to
coastal shallows). These acute stressor events are predicted to increase in
both duration and frequency due to climate change (Frölicher et al., 2018).
The proposed project will examine the impacts of warming and upwelling events
(with acidified water) on the nutritional status of Limacina helicina, a cold-
water pteropod that serves as an important dietary item for juvenile Pacific
salmon species in the Northern Pacific (Brodeur et al., 2007; Doubleday &amp;
Hopcroft, 2015; Sturdevant et al., 2012). For example, dietary analyses of
juvenile pink salmon and sockeye salmon within the Gulf of Alaska have shown a
predominance of L. helicina (Brodeur et al., 2007; Doubleday &amp; Hopcroft, 2015;
Sturdevant et al., 2012). Research has demonstrated that shell development,
growth, and survival of L. helicina are all highly susceptible to warming and
ocean acidification (Manno et al., 2017), but there has been limited
investigation of impacts to pteropod nutritional quality (i.e. composition)
under the context of acute stressor events. Prey nutritional quality is a key
aspect of feeding ecology that directly contributes to the survival of higher
trophic species (Ahlgren et al., 2005; Daly et al., 2010). In salmon,
variation in invertebrate prey quantity and quality may influence growth and
survival, especially during early marine residence (Litz et al., 2019).
Altered dietary lipid levels, for example, have been linked to changes in fish
growth, fat deposition, and digestive enzyme activity (Pelusio et al., 2021).
Consequently, we propose that any change in the nutritive status of L.
helicina under climate stressor conditions could have carry-over impacts to
juvenile salmon growth, health, and survival.

contributed to the decline of several Pacific salmon stocks in British
Columbia (BC). However, there are a multitude of non-fishing threats facing BC
salmon that have not been fully identified nor characterized including Aquatic
Invasive Species (AIS), harmful algal blooms (HABs), disease and pathogens,
persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals, etc. Further, many of these
stressors can interact such that the cumulative effect of these stressors is
likely greater than the sum of individual stressors. However, these stressors
are unlikely evenly distributed across the Pacific such that different stocks
will face different stressors and may respond differently. Thus, spatial and
stock considerations will be critical. Finally, these stressors are affecting
BC salmon at different life history stages across the freshwater, estuarine,
and marine systems they utilize to complete their life cycle with climate
change exacerbating the problem. By developing a decision support framework it
will be possible to identify and characterize the individual and multiple
stressors affecting salmon productivity or recovery in a standardized way
among Pacific salmon stocks. This will allow managers to better incorporate
and mitigate these non-fishing stressors most impacting salmon in decision
making. Not only will this conveying a more complete understanding of stock
status and threats to industry, stakeholders, and First Nations it will
facilitate the inclusion of this information in fisheries management plans and
SARA recovery plans. Further, this approach will allow targeting limited
resources to those stressors that can best be managed with a clearer
understanding of how salmon may be expected to respond when these threats are
mitigated.  
Based on the non-fishing threats identified in the previous year, along with
their expected impacts on BC salmon stocks, we will develop a geospatial
dataset of these threats that can then be attributed to individual stocks. By
developing an interaction matrix it will be possible to specify the stock-
specific threats facing BC salmon and clearly indicate which management
decision making processes need to include this information (e.g., fishing
plan, recovery plan).

At the Nov 2022 workshop our breakout group identified a number of known
stressors and in some cases we were able to identify specific threats to
salmon. However, we had a much longer list of potential stressors for which we
did not have subject matter experts. Thus, the first step will be to hire a
dedicated BI-02 who will undertake a literature review, including Fisheries
Management Plans, CSAS Advisory Documents, SARA Recovery Potential Assessments
and Recovery Plans, to identify a range of non-fishing stressors affecting
salmon and how DFO currently considers/doesn’t consider them in decision
making. The second step will be to talk to subject matter experts both withing
and outside DFO to fill information gaps that are identified during the
initial review. This preliminary list will then be used in the third step,
targeted workshops, where the experts will work to identify the causal
mechanisms behind these stressors (e.g., life history stage affected, type of
impact, duration, intensity, magnitude, recovery, etc.) and how they can be
better considered in DFO decision making. This dual approach of literature
review and expert opinions has been used previously to identify stressors
impacting kelp recovery in the Salish Sea (Hollarsmith et al. 2022).

Based on the results of the first two years of the project, the third year
will specifically develop decision support tools that will aid managers in how
best to incorporate non-fishing threats across an array of DFO management and
policy decision making processes, including, but not limited to Fisheries
Management, SARA recovery planning, SEP restoration activities, and FFHPP

formulated for Pacific salmon, which require a specific balance of nutrients
and other diet constituents to assure egg and juvenile quality, parr-smolt
transformation and subsequent performance in seawater (Hanson et al. 2016,

we propose to formulate and test new diets specific for the production of

The data collected in Year 1 will help us to select diets for use in feeding

Years 2 and 3. Collectively, these data will support the future formulation of
improved diets for Pacific salmon.

Feeding trials will be conducted at SEP hatcheries in Years 2 and 3 on
juvenile ocean-type Chinook and Coho salmon. The diets to be compared will be
selected based upon the results of Year 1 and agreed upon by the research team
and SEP staff. Dr. Forster, the project lead, has extensive experience in
conducting and peer-review publishing comparative feeding trials in salmon.
Other team members have extensive experience in the assessment of
physiological, immunological and health status of salmon.

Ultimately, this project will provide science-based advice to SEP facilities
on the use of supplemented or specially formulated diets to better meet the
needs of Pacific salmon and specifically address management concerns as to
whether current industry-formulated feeds administered to juvenile ocean-type
Chinook and Coho are sufficiently optimized.

emerging issue of concern for Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, in the
North Pacific. Thiamine is an essential vitamin for all organisms, that is
derived from their diet. Deficiency is most overtly expressed in salmonids as
early mortality of fry, but secondary effects impact all life stages. TDC was
first observed in the North Pacific in 2014 when up to 70% of Chinook from the
Yukon River, a system which has experienced declines in Chinook productivity,
were found to have limiting levels of egg thiamine (Larson and Howard 2019;
Honeyfield et al. 2016). In 2020, TDC was diagnosed for the first time in
California Chinook and found responsible for excessive fry mortality. Despite
its presence both north and south of BC, to date, only a single study has
measured thiamine levels in BC salmon and this included just two Chinook
(Welch et al. 2018). TDC may already be an important driver of BC Chinook
salmon population declines, and is expected to be an increasingly important
issue as oceans warm and prey communities change. Significantly, when TDC is
diagnosed there are effective treatment strategies to mitigate the effects
which can be applied in hatcheries to limit fry mortality. Assessment and
monitoring, of Thiamine deficiency can be used by SEP and StAD to inform
planning decisions for stocks where expectations of reduced spawning
performance may be expected, e.g., SEP could use this information to focus egg
collection efforts, or remediation actions such as Thiamine injection / baths,
on stocks that may be at greater risk of low spawning success. StAD could use
this information to improve their assessment of the current status and health
of salmon stocks.

levels of animal organization, these alterations are collectively known as the
stress response. The hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis which is
activated in response to most forms of stress in fish, initiates and regulates
the stress response. In fish cortisol is the predominant glucocorticoid
released as part of the primary stress response, and is critical for mediating
adaptive metabolic, physiological, and behavioral adjustments. However,
prolonged elevation of cortisol, due to extended or repeated exposure to
stressors, can negatively affect fish behavior, growth, reproduction and
immune functions (reviewed in Schreck and Tort, 2016).

The analysis of circulating (serum/plasma) cortisol is the most common method
used in stress response assessments in fish. This method works well under
controlled situations, where fish can be caught and rapidly sampled (within
minutes to avoid the rapid increase in cortisol which occurs in response to
capture stress) and it provides information on the acute stress response at
the time of collection (immediate state of stress). However, to understand
chronic stress the past cortisol history of individuals needs to be
understood. Fish scales have been recently recognized as a biomaterial that
accumulates cortisol, and other physiologically important hormones including
cortisone, over long periods of time. Moreover, scale cortisol levels are not
affected by stress associated with capture (reviewed in Laberge et al. 2019;
Kennedy and Janz, 2023).

Cortisol is released from the interrenals in fish as a biologically active
steroid hormone. At the tissue level, the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase type 2 (11βhsd2) converts cortisol into its biologically
inactive metabolite, cortisone. Importantly, this step is irreversible in
fish, highlighting the importance of 11βhsd2 in the regulation of cortisol
levels in teleosts (Tsachaki et al. 2017). Since 11βhsd2 is present in fish
skin, assessing the expression of this enzyme in the skin during chronic
stress, and measuring both cortisol and cortisone content will provide
critical context for scale cortisol deposition and clearance, and further
validate the use of scales as an indicator of chronic stress in fish.

We are proposing the use of levels of stress hormones (cortisol, cortisone) in
scales as a tool for routine monitoring of chronic stress in different life
history stages of Pacific salmon. As an example, this tool could be used to
examine individual and population effects of external stressors encountered
during migration on cortisol dynamics, which has implications with respect to
population resilience to stressors such as climate change. The use of scales
is minimally invasive and therefore suitable for use in populations of
conservation concern. However, to interpret values obtained from scales we
first need to understand the temporal profile of stress hormone accumulation
and rates of clearance in scales under different environmental conditions for
the different species of Pacific Salmon.

In this project we will conduct laboratory and hatchery-based studies to
determine/optimize: 1) sampling methods (e.g. study spatial heterogeneity of
scale stress hormone content (SSHC)), 2) effects of acute vs. chronic stress
on SSHC, 3) relationship between plasma and SSHC, 4) individual, stock and
temporal variability in SSHC, including changes associated with
smoltification, and 5) effects of unpredictable chronic stress on plasma and
SSHC. We will use, and modify, if necessary, analytical methods for SSHC that
have been used in studies of goldfish and rainbow trout (Laberge et al. 2019;
Kennedy and Janz, 2023).

are collected as part of DFO’s British Columbia Shore Station Program (BCSOP)
at twelve coastal stations that have been monitored for several decades, the
earliest commencing in 1914 (see map below).

The data are collected manually, by lighthouses keepers, at a daily interval.
Despite its success in providing data at remote locations for an outstanding
duration (one of the longest in the world of this kind), the program faces
challenges and limitations: gaps due to weather conditions, concerns with
lighthouse keepers payment, time lag between data collection and reception and
relatively coarse observational resolution. Theses challenges result in gaps
in the timeseries which can limit their otherwise wide range of possible
applications.

To address those challenges and enhance these valuable timeseries, we propose
the testing and deployment of autonomous systems which can record SST and SSS
at higher frequency (e.g. hourly) and transmit those data in near real-time.
The system would consist of an in-situ sensors package, a data logger and
transmitter and an antenna. Examples of such systems include elements of the
Ocean Network Canada (https://data.oceannetworks.ca/home) and of Smart
Atlantic, on the East coast
(https://www.smartatlantic.ca/station_alt.html?id=dfo_nharb).

The main outcome of this project will be the acquisitions of continuous, gap-
free, high resolution (hourly) timeseries of SST and SSS at key sites along
the BC coast. These timeseries would be available in real-time mode and/or
delay mode and posted online via the Open Data portal
(https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/719955f2-bf8e-44f7-bc26-6bd623e82884)
as well as on the Ocean Network Canada and Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing
System (CIOOS, https://cioos.ca/about/). The number of sites to be equipped
upon successful testing (1st year) will depend on budget available (details
below); a minimum of 4 stations would be necessary to be representative of the
BC coast as a whole, i.e. Salish Sea (Chrome Island to Race Rocks), West coast
(Amphitrite Point to Kains Island), North coast (Pine Island to Bonilla
Island) and Haida Gwaii (Langara Island). Region and station priorities would
be defined upon results of the first year tests and in coordination with other
researchers and PSSI priorities.

SST and SSS characteristics determine the suitability of marine ecosystems
habitat for native and invasive species that impacts migration patterns,
predator-prey relationships and stock abundance. Data from the BCSOP currently
contributes to fisheries management as input into forecasts of the northern
diversion of Fraser River sockeye and models of salmon and anchovy stock
abundance in the Strait of Georgia. Thus, enhanced data from this initiative
would not only strengthen the current applications but also be helpful to
newly implemented PSSI initiatives.

freshwater and is rapidly changing in many areas from human activities and
climate warming. Yet, it remains challenging to make explicit predictions
about how hydrology influences salmon. We aim to advance a mechanistic and
tractable modelling framework that links hydrology (flow and temperature) to
local-scale habitat availability and productivity potential of stream-rearing
juvenile salmon. The proposed approach integrates well-established theory of
geomorphology and fish energetics to predict how juvenile salmon rearing
habitat availability and productivity potential is influenced by dynamic flow
and temperature regimes (Fig. 1). The approach aims to be accessible by using
a tractable set of inputs that would emerge from typical field habitat
monitoring and is applicable across different systems and salmonid species. We
propose rolling out this modelling framework as part of a larger watershed-
scale research program in the North Thompson, where we have established an
extensive field monitoring network of flow, temperature, and habitat
conditions that would be direct model inputs. Ongoing intensive monitoring of
juvenile coho populations and physiological condition (D. Patterson proposal)
in these systems will inform model validation. For example, modelled
predictions could be directly compared to measures of coho abundance,
production, or physiological condition.

We anticipate 3 main outcomes from the work: (1) a modelling framework and
interface (e.g., R Shiny App); (2) predictions of how juvenile coho rearing
habitat availability and productivity potential responds to diverse flow and
temperature regimes across tributaries of the North Thompson; and (3) advice
to internal and external clients for setting environmental flow guidelines
under dynamic hydrologic conditions. For example, the work will directly plug
into ongoing engagement with the Thompson-Shuswap Environmental Flows
Committee, which is actively developing flow management guidelines and drought
response thresholds for the region. Further, the modelling framework will
provide a platform to explore the potential consequences of climate and land
use impacts on flows and temperatures, e.g., based on broader-scale, climate
averaged temperature and flow projections under climate change (J. Iacarella
proposal). This would provide a powerful, yet computationally simple and
accessible way to explore and communicate the dynamic relationships between
flows and salmon in a warming world. Overall, the approach is easily
extendable to other systems and salmonid species, thus could become a widely
used tool across the Province.

Approaches to predict biological responses to flow are integral to numerous
management issues. We envision the modelling framework informing regulatory
decision-making by FFHPP related to flow alterations (e.g., hydro operations
or water withdrawals), as well as land use and restoration planning. Our work
fills a gap for these applications given that existing instream flow modelling
tends to either be static and descriptive and thus not applicable to dynamic
conditions, or have prohibitively steep information and computational
requirements. This is a 3-year project that would support two parallel
elements: (1) collection of habitat, flow, and temperature data in coho
rearing tributaries across the North Thompson; and (2) development of model
structure and interface. Manuscript and report preparation and client
engagement will occur primarily in years 2 and 3.

Strait of Georgia. Recovery efforts have determined that the marine survival
of this population is very low, which is a major limiting factor to population
recovery. On water surveys of pinnipeds from the estuary out to the seal haul
outs on Hodgson Islands (approximately 2km from the estuary, Figure 1) during
the spring out-migration timing (since 2019) have estimated from approximately
100-350 harbour seals in the area.

This project was started as a pilot in 2022 to test the hypothesis that the
Hodgson Island harbour seal population is negatively affecting smolt survival,
and subsequently adult returns. The goal of the project is to transport and
release smolts past the seal haul out and then compare marine survival rates
between transported smolts and those out-migrating naturally. The pilot
project began with a low number of smolts transported in small trial releases
to test the effect of additional handling/ osmoregulation on fish as well as
the function of equipment. Small numbers of fish were PIT tagged to confirm
fish are able to recover from the procedure and be transported on the same
day. Additional activities included continuation of harbour seal counts
(Figure 2) on local haul outs during the smolt (May) and adult (July) peak
migration windows. Transport activities are conducted with shíshálh Nation’s
newly acquired 30 foot aluminum landing craft which is suited to this kind of
work.

In years 2-5 (spring 2023-2026), we propose scaling up releases to achieve
adequate sample sizes in order to properly test the hypothesis. A minimum of
1,000 and up to 2,500 PIT tagged sockeye are recommended per year such that a
1% survival will yield a total of 10-25 tag returns. Return rates of less than
1% may be too low to justify operationalizing this activity long term. The
transport of non-tagged fish should be avoided as to not confound comparisons
with the control group (untagged fence migrants). Results from 2023/24
releases will be realized in 2025/26 escapement years at which point a
decision on the future of the project can be made. Additional activities may
include walking the Hodson Island haul out with a mobile PIT tag antenna to
look for evidence of predation on out migrating smolts (river or transport
groups; Coho and Sockeye), or installing a PIT antenna on the haul out.

Sakinaw Sockeye has been confirmed as an endangered stock since 2003, and a
recovery potential assessment, completed in 2017 cited low marine survival as
the greatest limiting factor in recovery, with predator abundance and assumed
predation on smolts and adults ranked as high risk, with a critical level of
impact. Perpetually low marine survivals are preventing recovery such that the
persistence of the population is entirely dependent on a captive brood
program. This activity may be one of the few tools available to increase
survival.

freshets in the Chilko watershed is consistent with predicted hydrographic
changes for interior BC streams as a whole in response to climate variability,
with the average timing of the spring freshet expected to continue shifting
earlier as air temperatures rise. The future of operating the Chilko Sockeye
smolt weir is in jeopardy given the current trend related to the timing,
frequency, and strength of the spring freshets. If proven effective, the SONAR
method would provide an alternate assessment method for the Chilko watershed
that could be quickly employed in years when high flows either prevent the
installation of the weir at the beginning of the migration, or necessitate the
removal of the weir before the smolt migration is largely complete.

The objective of this work is to test the feasibility of using upward-looking
SONAR technology to assess daily abundances of Chilko Lake sockeye smolts as
they migrate downstream through the Chilko River. This technology has proven
to be effective for enumerating migrating smolts in comparable rivers in
Alaska. The reliably of the method will be evaluated based on how well the
daily SONAR-derived abundance indices predict the daily migration totals
observed at the counting weir that is deployed annually on the Chilko River. A
pilot study employing this technology was initiated within the Chilko
watershed in the spring of 2021, and following two consecutive years of data
collection the results appear to be promising; however, in both 2021 and 2022,
water levels have been below seasonal averages and we have yet to experience a
high-water event with the SONARs in place. Additional years of this project
are therefore required before any conclusions can be made regarding the
effectiveness of this technology as a substitute for the currently employed
counting weir on the Chilko River.

Pacific Ocean with spawning grounds located over a wide diversity of
freshwater habitats. In general, Pacific salmon return to their natal spawning
grounds to reproduce, and not surprisingly this has resulted in substantial
genetic variation among different salmon populations throughout the Canadian
range. Genetic variants among and within populations of the majority of
Canadian Pacific salmon have been characterized using relatively low numbers
of genetic markers, and this characterization has enabled the development of
the genetic-stock identification and parentage-based tagging programs within
Fisheries and Oceans Canada which provide vital information for management of
fisheries and hatcheries. Despite the utility of these developments, low-
density genetic markers are insufficient to assess adaptive genetic variation
in these species, leaving critical gaps for conserving fitness-associated
genetic diversity and for improving resilience to climate change. Previously,
the costs of next-generation sequencing were prohibitive for assessing genome-
wide genetic variation in species with large genomes such as salmonids.
However, reductions in these costs combined with publication of reference
genome sequences for the Pacific salmonids has opened novel opportunities to
address these gaps. The proposed project will utilize low-coverage whole-
genome resequencing to assess genome-wide patterns of genetic variation among
and within populations of Pacific salmon. These data will feed into several
analyses to identify genomic regions and variation involved in environmental
adaptation, to reassess the genetic support for currently defined conservation
unit boundaries, and to estimate the relative climate change resilience of
different populations of Canadian Pacific salmon. Initially, the proposed
project will focus on Chinook and Sockeye Salmon with a goal of sequencing
individuals from 48 populations of each species distributed across the
species’ range. We will leverage samples currently available in the Molecular
Genetics DNA archives to enable these efforts. In the longer-term, the
objectives of this project will expand these sequencing efforts to increase
the coverage of individuals, populations and species of Pacific salmon. This
expansion of scope will be necessary to fully consider conservation of within
population genetic diversity, and to resolve parallel patterns of genetic
adaptation across Pacific salmon in Canada. The first-year objectives of the
study are: 1) Identify 48 populations representative of the range-wide
diversity of Chinook and Sockeye Salmon. 2) Obtain samples from 18 Chinook
individuals or 8 Sockeye individuals from each identified population from the
Molecular Genetics DNA archives, and extract DNA for each sample. 3) Prepare
the extracted DNA samples for low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, and submit
the samples to an external sequencing service provider. 4) Collect relevant
environmental datasets and climate change projections for the locations and
life histories of the identified populations. 5) Receive sequencing reads for
all submitted DNA samples. The long-term objectives of the study are: 6) Align
sequencing reads from the first year of the study to the Chinook or Sockeye
Salmon reference genomes. 7) Determine allele frequency variation among and
within populations of each species. 8) Analyze genome-wide population
structure in each species and identify outlier regions of genetic
differentiation among populations. 9) Analyze genome-environment associations
to resolve environmental factors underlying genetic differentiation among
populations. 10) Utilize current inter-population genomic variation to
determine “genomic offsets” in the context of climate change projections
(i.e., the extent of genetic change necessary to parallel expected changes in
the environment). 11) Expand sampling and sequencing effort to include Chum,
Pink and Coho Salmon, and to add additional Chinook and Sockeye Salmon
population that address any gaps in the initial analysis. 12) Repeat the

Fish Ageing.

Demographic information such as age is critical for conservation management of
commercially and ecologically important fishes (Ricker1975; Hilborn and
Walters 1992; Campana and Thorrold 2001). Traditional fish age estimations are
determined by microscopically counting growth zones in a number of different
hard structures including scales and otoliths, a highly specialized skill that
requires years of training (Campana, 1992; Hesler et al., 2019). DFO Science
Sclerochronology lab provides internal and external DFO clients with age
estimates for numerous species of groundfish, pelagics, shellfish and salmon
including chinook, coho, chum and sockeye. This information contributes to
internal stock assessments and international treaties such as The Pacific
Salmon Treaty. The Sclerochronology lab is currently transitioning from a team
consisting of more senior agers to junior agers, a transition that will reduce
the lab output capacity. As such, the Sclerochronology lab is investigating
new methodologies with the potential of increasing fish ageing capacity and
efficiency. Fourier Transform-Near Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-NIRS) has
recently been applied to rapidly predict fish age, gaining attention among
fisheries managers as a potential alternative to timely and costly production
ageing of managed species (Passerotti et al., 2020). Age prediction capability
of FT-NIRS has been tested on the otoliths of chinook salmon (Claiborne et
al., 2019), walleye pollock (Hesler et al., 2019), red snapper (Passerotti et
al., 2020), barramundi (Wright et al., 2021), Pacific cod (Healy et al.,
2021), longnose skate (Arrington et al., 2021) as well as the vertebrae of two
shark species (Rigby et al. 2014, 2016), with potentially promising results.
Studies on eastern Bering Sea walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) have shown
that ages derived from FT-NIRS are not only precise but may demonstrate less
bias than traditional ageing methods (Helser et al., 2018).

Studies conducted by collaborators at NOAA have indicated that FT-NIRS has the
capacity to increase age outputs of walleye pollock from 35 ages per day to
360 ages per day (Hesler et al., 2019). If successful, new applications of FT-
NIRS technology will provide a promising approach to consolidate research
tools, operationalize timely data collection methods for age determination
directly benefiting fisheries researchers and managers, as well as other
research projects led by StAR, SEP, and Indigenous communities.

The overall objective of the proposed work is a proof of concept to establish
that the FT-NIRS can be used to precisely estimate the age of fishes regularly
assessed by the Sclerochronology lab, including the routinely aged salmon
species of chinook, coho, chum, and sockeye. Since salmon are aged using scale
structures, our research will first focus on fish species that are aged by
otoliths. Once we are familiar with the equipment and techniques and have
successfully passed the proof-of-concept phase, a range of new research
questions can be investigated such as determining whether salmon scales can be
scanned for precise age estimation.

Agriculture, Flood Control, and Hydro-power Generation, resulting in physical
exclusion from spawning and rearing habitats. Fishing rates have also been
high through history, with recent (2009-2018) exploitation rates around 60%.
The population in the U.S. section of the Okanagan River has recently ranged
from 7,000-14,000 spawners.

Rebuilding the abundance of Okanagan Chinook is a priority for First Nations

Recently, the Pacific Salmon Commission conducted a series of 5 workshops with
fisheries professionals and First Nations which examined threats, impediments
to survival, and mitigation approaches to increase the abundance of Okanagan
Chinook. Similarly, a Recovery Potential Assessment (DFO Pacific Region CSAS)
and DFO Risk Assessment Methods (RAMS) have been applied and also identified
threats and mitigations. Among the issues identified in these assessments, the
key ones include Climate Change and its influence on the thermal and
hydrological regime of the Okanagan, channelization and the disconnection of
the main river channels from the historic and off-channel stream habitats, and
predation by invasive fish species. Two of the data gaps that were highlighted
from this work are the juvenile habitat use in the Okanagan, which has been
highly disturbed and degraded, and the level of predation on juvenile Chinook
salmon by native and non-native fishes. To enable rebuilding it will be
essential to have information on habitat use and to understand the threat
posed by predation. Graduate students provide the most efficient way to answer
these critical research questions. The use of graduate students will allow for
targeted and timely research while building capacity and knowledge for when

eastern North America, have been introduced into Cultus Lake, British
Columbia. Cultus Lake is home to endangered sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus
nerka) as well as endemic Cultus pygmy sculpin (Cottus aleuticus). Smallmouth
bass introduced in other salmon-bearing habitat have been observed to exert
substantial mortality on salmon fry and smolts, suggesting a similar impact
may be possible in Cultus Lake. Observations of sockeye salmon, and Cultus
pygmy sculpin in the diet of captured smallmouth bass demonstrates predation
upon two native species at risk. While smallmouth bass represent a threat to
the Cultus Lake native fish community and species at risk specifically, they
are also highly valued by some anglers. Importantly, as a source population,
they also represent a real and present threat to other ecosystems in the Lower
Mainland. Smallmouth bass are often found in streams and rivers; in fact, they
have already been found downstream of Cultus Lake. Additionally, there is the
threat of anglers moving smallmouth bass to other waterbodies in the Lower
Mainland to create new bass fisheries, which themselves would create risk to
receiving environments. While there are largemouth bass (M. salmoides)
populations in various waterbodies throughout the Lower Mainland, this is the
first verified smallmouth bass population, and has drawn a lot of attention
from the angling community. Early work on this population has identified a
divergence of public opinions: some value native species (especially sockeye
salmon) and want to see bass suppressed; other values angling opportunities
for smallmouth bass and will strongly oppose any measures to affect this
valued fishery resource.

There are two issues that this project will address: (1) understanding which
suppression options will result in the lowest opposition from anglers and
community members, thereby identifying the risk of unintended consequences
(e.g., additional transfers to other lakes); and (2) determining the
suppression strategy (combination of different suppression options) which will
best inform estimates of effectiveness for each suppression option so as to
maximize effective suppression moving forward to reduce impacts on sockeye
salmon recruitment.

In year one of this project, an electrofishing boat will be used to capture
smallmouth bass, and all bass will be tagged with passive integrated
transponders (PIT tags). These PIT-tagged fish will help determine the initial
population size (through mark-recapture methods) and provide a baseline for
future smallmouth bass suppression efforts. A subset of smallmouth bass will
also be tagged using acoustic transmitters (n=25; Vemco V9 &amp; V13 acoustic
tags) to track their movements within the Cultus Lake system, and to determine
if any emigration out of the system is occurring.

The smallmouth bass fishery will be monitored to assess total fishing effort
(using standard access point creel survey procedures), harvest rates, harvest
size, and catch rates (total number fish released + harvested). All harvested
bass reported by anglers will be measured, weighted, scanned for PIT tags, and
have scales removed for later aging. Additionally, as part of the catch
monitoring program anglers will be surveyed to determine their level of
satisfaction with their bass catch rates and size, native fish catch rates and
their opinions on the different suppression options considered. These survey
answers will allow for changes in utility and attitudes to be tracked over
time.

Lastly, nest destruction and removal of male bass guarding nests is to occur
once spawning begins in the spring. Bass activity in the spring should be
monitored frequently to identify the start of spawning season. Once nests are
constructed, a survey of known spawning locations should occur to identify
nests for destruction. Captured males will be measured, weighed, have sex and
maturity status confirmed, scanned for PIT tags, and have scales and/or
otoliths removed for aging.

Province of BC, and the DFO. Please see the attached &quot;Cultus Lake Smallmouth

temperature, oxygen, and salinity, they do not tell us whether fish are
actually experiencing stress, or possibly avoiding areas where these stressors
occur. Fit-Chip data allow us to directly test whether the highest ranking
environmental risk factors identified in the WCVI Marine Risk
Assessments—elevated temperature summer through early fall and reduced oxygen
in the fall, the moderate risk of carryover effects (in this case smolt
readiness rather than size) and exposure to HABs, cause physiological stress
and impairment in Chinook salmon. Moreover, Fit-Chips can effectively identify
habitats where salmon are least vs most compromised, allowing regulators and
habitat biologists to target remediation where needed most, with remediation
success tracked via decreased stress.

Working within the West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) &quot;Follow the fish
Research Consortium funded under PSSI, under objective 1, we will run Fit-
Chips on 2,000 Chinook released from Robertson and Nitinat hatcheries sampled
over the migration trajectory from freshwater-estuary-marine, including
overwintering Chinook caught across all 5 WCVI sounds through microtrolling
led by local First Nations. Using a south coast wide Fit-Chip dataset
developed in 2022-2023 using PSSI funding, comprised of over 4500 Chinook
sampled from 2008-2018, we will employ stock-recruitment models to identify
associations between individual stressors and population-level survival across
the southern BC coast, and build a new model framework to address the
cumulative interplay between stress and disease undermining survival. This
analysis will address several of the risk factors identified in the WCVI
Marine Risk Assessment for Chinook salmon, including climate-driven
environmental stressors (temperature, hypoxia, salinity) and
pathogens/disease, and their association with survival. We will then apply
this knowledge to our Fit-Chip data on WCVI Chinook collected from 2022-2024,
along with the physical oceanographic data collected at the same time, to
identify where and when environmental stressors are “felt” by WCVI Chinook,
including their relationship with measured environmental parameters, and where
and when signs of increased morbidity occur. Importantly, this spatial
analysis will also address the anthropogenically controlled intrinsic and
extrinsic factors associated with stressors and diseases that pose the highest
population-level risk to WCVI Chinook. The ultimate goal is to identify
stressor and/or disease impacts that can be effectively mediated to increase
early marine survival of salmon, and habitats where mediation is most urgently
required.

The WCVI Marine Risk Assessments identified prey availability/feeding a high
current and future risk, pathogens/parasites a moderate current and high
future risk, and predation/HABs a moderate risks. Data gaps were identified
for all of these risk factors. While multiple individual projects are proposed
to tackle most of these risk factors and where they are most strongly felt in
Barclay and Clayoquot Sound, eDNA offers a more holistic tool to identify the
species compositions – e.g. salmon spp, predators, prey, competitors,
infective agents, HABs, that can corroborate community assessment more
efficiently over a broader spatial scale. Under objective 2, we will carry out
eDNA sampling in the same areas and seasons where the follow the fish project
is actively catching fish, starting in the estuaries and Barclay Sound in
spring/summer, and moving into Clayoquot sound in the early fall and
throughout all five sounds overwinter. In addition to providing an ecosystem
characterization via metabarcoding, and pathogens through our infective agent
monitoring system -- including potential hot-spot areas around
farms/processing plants, eDNA may also provide more information on areas of
the sound where salmon are more or less abundant. Importantly, under this
objective we will integrate data analyses with projects using a more
traditional species assessments (e.g. via plankton sampling, HAB monitoring,
hydroacoustics). Importantly, when contrasting eDNA community compositions in
ecosystems where salmon show indices of optimal vs compromised health, we can
provide a second pillar to develop and measure the effectiveness of mediation
efforts.

modernized approach to conduct proactive holistic assessments of salmon health
and infectious agents in two SEP hatcheries: Robertson Creek and Nitinat.
Holistic health will be monitored with the innovative salmon Fit-Chip
technology developed by Dr. Miller’s laboratory. Fit-Chips can simultaneously
monitor pathogen RNA and host biomarkers predictive of specific stressor
(thermal, osmotic, oxygen), disease (viral disease, inflammatory response,
immune activation, imminent mortality), and developmental (pre-smolt, smolt,
de-smolt) states in salmon based on profiling from non-lethal (in smolt-size
fish) gill biopsy samples. This study will continue to collaboratively develop
a purpose-built SEP Fit-Chip that incorporates the biomarker panels with
assays to key pathogens of interest to SEP.

OBJECTIVE 1: We will apply Fit-Chip technology proactively, establishing
baseline data from the two hatcheries where Chinook tanks/ponds will be
sampled and immediately analyzed monthly post hatch until release. Where
issues with animal welfare arise, more frequent sampling can be undertaken
(see objective 4). With these data, we can assess shifts in health status over
time, identify potential physiological factors, stressors or pathogens
associated with elevated mortality, and measure physiological outcomes of
mitigation steps or shifts in husbandry practices. Fit-Chips will also be
applied to stage smolt readiness to minimize osmotic stress and maximize
survivorship upon release. Fit-Chips will also be applied to fish held in sea
pens (live and moribund where possible) to assess adaptation post-release and
to identify factors contributing to physiological shifts in moribund fish.
Post-release from sea pens, a sister project integrated with the WCVI “Follow
the Fish” (FtF) PSSI research team will fund application of Fit-Chips to
monitor shifts in health status over the 2-3 months Chinook spend in river and
estuarine environments (removed from the budget herein), and the first year of
marine rearing. Importantly, the imminent mortality biomarker panel, which can
predict natural mortality within 72 hours, will provide a means to assess
shifts in survival during post-release rearing.

OBJECTIVE 2: At the same time that fish are being collected in hatchery,
replicate filtered water samples will be collected for environmental (e)RNA
assessments using the same Fit-Chip technology. eRNA has already proven to be
highly useful for (live) pathogen monitoring, but we will also explore if
shifts in the health of fish in tanks and net-pens can be observed at a
population level by the shed salmon RNA comparable to the established
assessment of individuals. If this were the case, eRNA assessments would
provide a completely non-invasive tool to track health and condition of
cultured fish. For net pen samples (and post-release samples funded in the
sister FtF PSSI project [removed from budget herein], eDNA/RNA will be
collected and metabarcode sequencing will be applied to identify the species
compositions (salmon spp., prey, competitors, predators, pathogens) that
comprise the natural environments for Nitinat and Robertson Creek smolt
releases. Note that results from the first year are just coming in on the eRNA
objective, and look quite promising. To increase sensitivity, however, we are
doubling the eRNA filters to collect water samples as due to constant feeding
towards the end of production, we were unable to get a full 5L filtrate for
each filter, which reduced the sensitivity to detect fish RNA. We will work
with hatcheries to try to reduce feeding the hour before sampling and double
up on filters to resolve this issue.

OBJECTIVE 3: In order to maximize the relevance of the holistic health
assessments, production, husbandry, and environmental data will need to be
provided by SEP to facilitate association-based analysis of the Fit-Chip and
eRNA data. In the first year, we began the development of a purpose-built SEP
Genomic database and starting writing R-Markdown scripts to automatically
produce the data graphics for reporting back. We did not have salary for this
objective in the budget in the first year, which slowed progress, so this year
we are adding 1 month for database support (Llewellyn) and 1 month for
analytical support (Bass) to ensure time is dedicated to this task so that
rapid turn-around for Fit-Chip results back to hatchery managers (&lt;2 weeks if
no urgent event, &lt;1week for responsive sampling (e.g. mortalities, release
decisions). “eRNA” technology can also include swab sampling to find sources
of live pathogens if a particular infectious disease outbreak occurs. Given
the potential to introduce new pathogens/parasites with transitions from
ground to natural river/lake water sources, eRNA will be collected prior to
transitioning to conduct a thorough assessment of infective agents that may be
introduced; those detected will be added to Fit-Chip panels thereafter to
assess whether hatchery fish become infected (myxozoans present the highest
risk of introduction).

of supporting wild salmon populations. Objectives of hatchery enhancement span
conserving at-risk stocks, rebuilding lower abundance stocks, providing
harvest opportunities and increasing public awareness through outreach and
education. However, there are also risks associated with hatchery enhancement;
differences between a hatchery and a natural habitat affect both the genetic
and environmental factors that shape the performance and fitness of salmon.
Consequently, hatchery-origin salmon may be less suited to wild habitats than
their natural-origin counterparts, and the presence of hatchery-origin fish on
a natural spawning ground may reduce the fitness of a population overall. The
relative fitness of hatchery-origin compared to natural-origin salmon has been
estimated in a handful of systems through determination of relative
reproductive success (RRS). In these studies, returning adults are assigned
back to their parents using genetic tags called parentage-based tags, and RRS
is inferred by the number of returns per family from hatchery-origin compared
to natural-origin parents. In general, the results of RRS studies suggest that
hatchery-origin fish have lower natural reproductive success than natural-
origin fish, and this reduced RRS is potentially transferred across
generations. Despite this pattern, the extent to which hatchery-origin fitness
is lower than natural-origin fitness is likely dependent on current and
historical factors impacting specific systems, including hatchery practices.
To date, no study has estimated the RRS of hatchery- and natural-origin
Pacific salmonids in integrated populations enhanced by the Fisheries and
Oceans Canada Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). This is a critical knowledge
gap for effectively managing hatchery production, as genetic management of
these systems currently assumes a RRS of 0.8. This value is a reasonable
consensus value from published estimates in USA rivers, but the SEP has had
clear guidelines for genetic management since at least the 1980s, and it is
possible that RRS estimates from USA hatcheries are inaccurate for SEP
hatcheries. Utilization of an inaccurate RRS estimate could result in
mismanagement of genetic risks associated with hatchery production, because
the number of hatchery-origin fish that are predicted to utilize the natural
spawning grounds increases as RRS increases, whereas a high RRS infers
relatively low negative consequences for fitness associated with hatchery-
origin spawners. Therefore, accurate estimation of RRS is important for
effective genetic management of SEP hatcheries, particularly in the context of
managing the influences of the hatchery and natural environments on the
adaptive trajectories of integrated populations (i.e., proportionate natural
influence or “PNI”). The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Initiate
extensive genetic sampling of both the escapement and broodstock for at least
one Pacific salmon population enhanced by the SEP (confirmed population:
Sarita River Chinook Salmon). 2) Use a genetic biomarker panel to genotype
these natural-origin and hatchery-origin parents. 3) Explore alternative
approaches to enable widespread RRS estimation across SEP hatcheries even in
systems where extensively escapement sampling is infeasible. The long-term
objectives of the study are: 4) Explore options to increase sampling efforts
to approach comprehensive escapement sampling in future years. 5) Continue
these genetic sampling efforts to derive parentage-based tags for returning
adults from both hatchery-origin and natural-origin production. 6) Estimate
RRS in SEP hatcheries to allow improved management of genetic risks associated
with hatchery influences.

all Pacific salmonids. One important life history strategy in male Chinooks is
to return after one fewer year in the marine environment than the earliest
returning females. These early-returning males or “jacks” are relatively
small, and participate in spawning by employing an opportunistic “sneaker”
strategy to fertilize small numbers of eggs from many spawning events
involving females and larger, more dominant, males. In general, spawning
success in Chinook Salmon is closely related to size; however, jacks
experience the risk marine predation for at least one less year than other
males, and the success of jacks is a product of negative frequency-dependent
selection. In other words, as the proportion of large males increases, the
relative success of jacks increases, whereas as the proportion of jacks
increases, the relative success of jacks decreases. In addition, from an
evolutionary perspective jack males represent an important natural avenue of
gene flow between different spawning years in Pacific salmon species.
Therefore, the natural occurrence of low frequencies of jack males in Chinook
Salmon populations is likely beneficial for the population and species as a
whole. There are both genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the
tendency of a male Chinook to return as a jack, and current understanding
suggests that growth rates at early life stages combined with size-at-age
thresholds play key roles in the likelihood of observing the jack phenotype
later in life. These factors suggest that hatchery enhancement may
artificially raise the proportion of jack males in a population, and this has
been observed in some hatchery lines. Despite the importance of the jack life
history strategy overall, there is no doubt that larger Chinook males are more
successful on the spawning grounds, and larger salmon are more valuable to
fisheries. Consequently, there are concerns that hatchery enhancement may
shift the distribution of ages of return towards younger age classes with
negative consequences for both harvest and population-level fitness. To
mitigate the risk of shifting a population’s average age of return, hatcheries
may manage jacks in broodstock differently than other males by preferentially
retaining older males. The jack phenotype is known to be inherited to a
reasonable extent, and thus this broodstock screening should counter the
likelihood of overrepresentation of jack fathers in hatchery-origin offspring.
However, as genetic and environmental factors impact the tendency to jack,
broodstock management would be improved and facilitated if jacks among the
potential brood could be screened specifically for the genetic factors
underlying the jack phenotype; these factors are the most likely to directly
impact the proportion of jacks in the subsequent generation of hatchery-origin
offspring. Recent research has shown that specific y-chromosome haplotypes are
strongly associated with the tendency of a male to return as a jack, but these
haplotypes are unique to different regions. Y-chromosome haplotypes in
Canadian Chinook Salmon have not be characterized in the context of ages of
return for any population, impairing the ability to develop genetic tools to
refine hatchery broodstock management. Therefore, resolving the genetic
variants responsible for known inheritance of the jack life history strategy
is an important step in improving genetic hatchery management in the Fisheries
and Oceans Canada Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). The first-year
objectives of the study are: 1) Identify males of known age classes from
previously genotyped broodstock from three Chinook populations enhanced by SEP
(confirmed populations: Chilliwack River Fall, Puntledge River Fall and
Qualicum River). 2) Perform reduced-representation sequencing on 256 males
from each population across age classes with approximately 80 jacks per
population. 3) Analyze genotype-phenotype associations between genetic
variants and the age of return among individuals, including a specific
analysis of y-chromosome haplotypes. The long-term objectives of the study
are: 4) Expand these analyses to include additional SEP-enhanced Chinook
populations from other regions to confirm the generality of genetic
associations. 5) Design genetic tools to allow rapid screening of genetic
variants that have large effects on the tendency of a male Chinook to return
as a jack. 6) Potentially expand these analyses to examine genetic
associations with age of return in female Chinook, which would also support
genetic management of SEP broodstocks.

Consequently, hatchery-origin salmon may be less suited to wild habitats than

Despite the known risks and consequences of hatchery enhancement, major
genetic differences between hatchery-origin and natural-origin salmonids as a
result of hatchery-mediated selection or relaxed selection have generally not
been observed in integrated populations. In contrast, substantial epigenetic
differences have been detected between hatchery-origin and natural-origin
Pacific salmonids. Epigenetic variants are structural changes to DNA without a
change in the DNA sequence itself. For example, DNA methylation is a commonly
studied epigenetic mechanism in which a methyl group (-CH3) is covalently
added to a cytosine residue. These modifications to DNA can alter the function
of the genome, particularly through the regulation of gene expression. Given
the extent of variation in epigenetic signatures between hatchery-origin and
natural-origin salmon, the functional effects of epigenetic variants are
excellent candidates to underlie the fitness consequences associated with
hatchery enhancement. Additionally, it is possible for hatchery epigenetic
variants to be inherited by the offspring of hatchery-origin fish, which
aligns with the potential for long-term reductions in population fitness as
hatchery-origin fish spawn in natural habitats. The study of epigenetic
variation in Pacific salmonids is relatively in its infancy, but epigenetic
biomarkers are a promising tool to facilitate managing hatchery enhancement
specifically and salmon fisheries generally. A critical knowledge gap in the
generation of these tools is that epigenetic differences between hatchery- and

populations or across populations enhanced by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada
Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). Therefore, a comprehensive examination of
DNA methylation between hatchery- and natural-origin Canadian Chinook Salmon
is a high priority, which will be followed by the development of epigenetic
biomarkers and tools for monitoring and management. The first-year objectives
of the study are: 1) Identify hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook Salmon in
broodstock from five SEP hatcheries through assignments of parentage-based
tags (confirmed hatchery lines: Nicola River, Quinsam River, Sarita River,
Atnarko River Upper, Chilliwack River Fall, Chilliwack River Summer). 2)

female and male hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook Salmon across difference
age classes of return. 3) Determine hatchery-origin epigenetic variants that

throughput molecular tools to screen epigenetic biomarkers in Chinook Salmon
(e.g. pyrosequencing, eDNA methylation sequencing) 6) Expand the regional
coverage of hatchery lines assessed to confirm generality of hatchery-origin
variants across SEP programming. 7) Fully assess and resolve regional and
hatchery specific epigenetic differences between hatchery- and natural-origin

change projections, and population dynamics models can provide cautionary
flags that identify potentially stressed or vulnerable watersheds and/or
populations (e.g., RPA status assessment, Pacific Salmon Explorer). These
approaches are useful for initial watershed or population prioritization.
However, in most cases these approaches are limited in their ability to
accurately describe the cumulative impact that multiple stressors can have on
individuals and specific populations because they lack a mechanistic approach
that can verify the complex interacting pathways of effects on fish (Peacock,
Braun, Hodgson et al., 2023). This complexity makes it difficult to understand
how future landscape alterations and climate change will affect salmon in a
given watershed; thus limiting our ability to provide specific advice to
managers on how to predict which mitigation or recovery actions (e.g. habitat
restoration, harvest reductions) will most effectively recover salmon
populations. We propose to link in situ ecophysiology information with other
biophysical habitat monitoring data to develop mechanistic relationships that
address management issues around habitat-population modeling, assessment of
restoration function, and fish responses to climate change. The specific
management questions are: Q1) What multi-factor stressors limit stage specific
freshwater habitat distribution? Q2) What are the key drivers of stage-
specific survival and growth for life-cycle modelling? Q3) What is the role of
temperature in combination with other key factors in predicting climate change
impacts on salmon growth and survival in a given habitat (e.g. lake, river,
wetlands)? Q4) What are major habitat factors that affect salmon growth and
survival to consider in planning and assessment of habitat mitigation,
restoration, and offsetting effectiveness? The proposal is to execute a series
of projects that directly address these management questions through two main
outcomes 1) improved understanding of cumulative effects, and co-development
of 2) tools and approaches to guide future mechanistic assessments of
cumulative impacts. Improve Understanding: For year 1 &amp; 2, we propose to
continue work on cumulative impact projects: 1) development of in situ stage
specific mechanistic relationships among biophysical factors (dissolved oxygen
(DO), temperature, flow, conspecific competition), distribution, physiological
condition metrics, growth, and survival for juvenile salmonids – all measure
in situ, 2) continue to develop and evaluate ecophysiology tools related to
evaluating fish condition. Life-stage specific mechanistic relationships will
be examined using samples in-hand from three large scale field programs
(Lakes, E-Watch, North Thompson Salmon Ecosystem Program) within the
Freshwater Ecosystems Section. All three programs generate unique multi-year
population data on multiple biophysical factors influencing juvenile salmon
condition, growth, and survival such as, water quality, conspecific density,
temperature, food availability, primary productivity, DO and water level in
lakes, wetlands, and flows in rivers. Models examining the effects of multiple
biophysical factors on condition will be used to understand how interacting
biophysical drivers (including stressors) shape fish condition, while models
examining relationships between condition metrics and growth and/or survival
will examine the use of condition metrics as tools to indicate future salmon
presence, growth and survival. Concomitant lab work is ongoing to support the
development of ecophysiology tools, such as growth hormones (IgF) for
freshwater salmon growth, troponin for oxygen stress, and triglycerides (TAG)
for nutritional status, that can be used as potential indicators of habitat
quality. For Year 3&amp;4 we will use the results from year 1&amp;2 to identify and
test key knowledge gaps on cumulative effects in salmon (e.g. Iacarella
proposal). This selection of multifactor field experiments could include: low
DO and high temperature; food availability, temperature, and growth/survival;
pH and temperature tolerance experiments with preference/avoidance behaviour
studies; and temperature and migratory stressors on in-river survival
Sockeye/Chinook/Coho. This project is distinct from related PSSI proposals in
that we are proposing a mechanistic approach to test the cumulative impact of
multiple factors directly on individual fish response (i.e. growth, survival,
stress) in their native habitats, leveraging multiple program expertise both
within the freshwater section and beyond. Our experience is that science
advice to major management decisions are best supported by a mechanistic
understanding how environmental and physiological processes directly impact
fish themselves. This is foundational work that can then be used to generate
population responses were appropriate. However, we acknowledge that not all
management questions to science require such an in-depth experimental
approach, which is why we are proposing the guideline development to help
managers and researchers prioritize how best to approach assessing cumulative
impacts, as well as work with the other related projects. The proposal is
complementary to other PSSI science proposals in that we are addressing
similar questions, but at different spatial scales (e.g. Iacarella’s broad
region-wide scale) and biological levels of organization. The work also
complements broad-scale modeled predictions of discharge, temperature, and DO,
that can be used with our mechanistic relationships to generate robust
predictions of fish responses to climate change. More specifically, we will
help test some of key stressor interactions that emerge as pervasive across
the province from Iacarells’s proposal with field-based studies. We will
directly link the outputs from Naman’s model of habitat suitability with
direct measures of fish condition, fish performance and survival (i.e. a form
of cross validation). We will work with Czembor’s group to share ideas on the
state of knowledge of key limiting factors, and evaluate fit-chips as a
potential ecophysiological tool from the Miller proposal. Tools and
Approaches: We will synthesize approaches and our results to develop a
pragmatic guide for initiating mechanistic cumulative effects investigations.
We started with a literature review (Y1-2) of current methods for assessing
physiological condition, as an integrated measure of habitat quality. The
review will examine the benefits and limitations of these different
physiological condition metrics and span metrics that include genomic,
transcriptomic (fitchips), proteins (e.g. hormones, enzymes), metabolites
(TAGs, ions), and phenotypes (size). This verification of physiological tools
will be done in conjunction with assessing different habitat monitoring and
modelling approaches (e.g. Cunningham 2022; Naman proposal) to verify Value of
Information. For Year 3 &amp; 4\. The culmination of the literature review and
field/lab projects will be a pragmatic guide for a tiered approach (i.e.
opinions, reviews, observations, hypothesis testing, quantification of
uncertainty) to initiate mechanistic cumulative effects investigations that

The fishery,
that averaged about 15,000 t between 1950-1989, declined sharply since 2010
and in 2022 was only 180 t. The catch in 2023 appears to be as low or lower.
In addition to the collapse of the fishery, there is a collapse of
escapements. Atlas et al (2022) reported an 80-90% collapse in spawning chum
salmon abundance in Central Coast rivers since 1960. The Fraser River,
historically the largest producer of Chum salmon in BC, may not reach targeted
escapement for 2023 despite not allowing any fishing. Additionally, targeted
chum escapements for numerous other rivers flowing into the Strait of Georgia
appear to be alarmingly low in 2023. These declines in chum salmon are as
equally, or even more alarming, as the collapse of southern BC coho salmon
escapements in the 1990s that resulted in the closure of key fisheries. The
dramatic declines of chum salmon have not only impacted commercial fisheries,
historically the most important salmon fishery by weight in BC, but declines
have significant implications to First Nations. Additionally, Hanson et al
(2001) demonstrated that chum salmon were 2 to 3 times more important in the
diet than Chinook salmon during the fall and early winter for “southern
resident killer whales” adding an additional concern for the protection of
southern resident killer whales.

The reasons for the declines in chum salmon are not understood and not
studied. We have 25 years of juvenile chum catches in the Strait of Georgia
and three years of catches of British Columbia chum salmon in the winter in
the Gulf of Alaska that we can use to develop hypotheses to explain why
declines are occurring and what might be done to manage existing populations
to maximize future production as ocean ecosystems change.

There is no trend in the catches of juvenile chum salmon in the juvenile
salmon surveys conducted by the Salmon Marine Interactions Program in the
Strait of Georgia for the past 25 years indicating that the number of
juveniles entering the ocean has not declined. However, there has been no
stock specific DNA analysis completed for the juvenile chum salmon catches in
these surveys in the Strait of Georgia because funds were not available.
Surveys in the Gulf of Alaska in the winter of 2019, 2020 and 2020 were the
first studies of Canadian chum salmon during the winter. DNA and age analysis
indicated that although Canadian chum salmon in their first winter in the
ocean were encountered, there were very few Canadian chum salmon in their 2nd,
3rd or 4th winters. However, these older age classes were encountered for chum
salmon that originated from Alaska, Russia and Japan. Therefore, results from
the winter expeditions and results from the juvenile salmon surveys suggest
that recent declines occur before or about the time of the first ocean winter.

This project will produce stock specific juvenile abundances of chum salmon in
the summer and fall survey catches in the Strait of Georgia. These abundances
will be used to determine if there are stock specific trends in abundance over
the 25 years of sampling or stock specific patterns of juveniles remaining in
the Strait of Georgia through their first marine summer. The stock specific
abundances will also be compared to the stock composition of chum in the
catches from our winter surveys in the Gulf of Alaska. Resulting relationships
with survey abundance trends, escapements, hatchery production, stock specific
growth and condition will be used to develop hypotheses for possible causes of
the decline in ocean survival of BC chum salmon and what can be done to
maximize survival in the future of changing ocean ecosystems.

shelter, and salinity acclimatization before they undergo a multi-year
migration across the Pacific Ocean for many years. Since harpacticoids provide
a link between primary production (benthic diatom biofilms) and tertiary
production at higher trophic levels (salmon-smolts, sandpipers), harpacticoids
can transfer diatom-derived a high-quality food consisting of long-chain
polysaccharide unsaturated fatty-acids (LC-PUFAs) that serve as a high-quality
migration fuel for salmon smolts. However, modelling scenarios of salinity
estimates on Roberts Bank shows a salinity regime shift towards freshwater 34%
relative to that of the existing tidal flats conditions between pre- and post-
construction of Roberts Bank Terminal-2 (RBT2). On Roberts Bank, the alignment
of diatom-harpacticoid-salmon trophic levels and transfer of LC-PUFAs across
trophic levels must be sustained to avoid a potential “match–mismatch”
scenario (McKinnell and Irvine, 2021). This timely pairing of predator and
prey is also crucial for 1.5 million Western sandpipers (Caldris mauri), that
migrate between Panama to Alaska annually (April 15 – May 15) and stopover on
Roberts Bank tidal flats. Western sandpipers also rely on diatom biofilms (LC-
PUFAs) for fuel for the long migration to Alaska (Warnock and Bishop, 1998;
Elner et al, 2005; Kuwae et al. 2008; Mathot et al. 2010). Given the overlap
of 1) migration stopover location and timing for both salmon and sandpipers on
Roberts Bank; and 2) similar prey preferences (benthic diatom biofilms) and
required LC-PUFAs for migration fuel, a competitive interaction may occur
under these circumstances, leading to a match-mismatch scenario for both
benthic diatom predators. Furthermore, the predicted reduction of salinity due
to RBT2 construction during the season of freshet and migration stopovers of
both salmon and sandpiper, may apply a significant environmental stressor to
this competition for high-quality food.

and fish health, and a major budget item for salmonid enhancement facilities
in BC (~ overall 1 million CAD/year). Feed is a perishable item, however. The
quality will change if feed is exposed to air, adverse conditions, or
prolonged storage time. Ingredients including proteins, lipids, vitamins, and
pigments are heat- and moisture-sensitive. Feed can degrade and become
conducive to mold growth when exposed to extended periods of high temperature
and/or humid conditions. Moreover, there has been significant refinement in
fish feed formulations to partially replace finite and expensive marine
ingredients, such as fish meal and fish oil, with less costly, possibly more
sustainable, and more stable supplies of terrestrial ingredients; these may
not necessarily be suitable for growing fish for enhancement purpose (Colombo
and Turchini 2021). The quality of marine ingredients also fluctuates with the
increasingly unpredictable ocean conditions. These, and other, uncertainties
highlight the need to establish a feed sampling program to verify feed quality
and relay potential concerns to suppliers such that rapid improvements can be
made.

In the past, SEP collaborated with the DFO Fish Nutrition Lab (then under Dr.
David Higgs), located in West Vancouver. Dr. Higgs was an expert in
understanding nutritionally related fish mortality events. As an example, he
was involved in identifying the role of zinc deficiency on Chinook cataract
development (Richardson et al. 1985). His laboratory was also instrumental in
providing feed quality assessments through the 1990’s and early 2000’s and the
analytical support program for assessing SEP’s feed supplies at West Vancouver
Laboratory (now the Pacific Science Enterprise Centre, PSEC) ended with Dr.
Higgs’ retirement, close to two decades ago. In contrast, the US Fish and
Wildlife Service agency (Abernathy Fish Technology Center) examines fish feed
received by enhancement hatcheries located in the US Pacific Regions and
generates a quarterly report by probing into feed proximate composition
(protein, fat, ash, moisture) and rancidity related parameters (peroxide
value, free fatty acids, thiobarbituric acid). It is not uncommon that the
results show deviations in fat and protein contents and elevated rancidity
levels (oil degradation) relative to the manufacturer ingredient label and
quality standard (i.e. Fish feed quality control report 2024). The goal here
is to establish a feed sampling program to provide advice (feed
quality/storage) for salmon enhancement facilities in BC, and communicate the
results internally and externally, and to assess the viability of a long-term

and ambiguous world. How do hatchery managers move forward despite these
uncertainties and overcome “management paralysis” in the context of climate
change?

What is being proposed: We will use scenario planning to develop insight into
how SEP/DFO can better ensure that hatchery planning and implementation is
adaptable to climate change impacts over the next 20 years. Year 1 will focus
on a DFO internal process and plan for broader engagement in Year 2 with
Indigenous knowledge experts.

Scenario planning enables organizations to embrace uncertainty by expanding
their understanding of the plausible range of futures they may experience.
Scenarios are meant to guide and inform organizations about potential future
changes that will impact how they operate. These processes enable
organizations to be better positioned to deal with unexpected threats, and
take advantage of unexpected opportunities.

Scenario planning is a structured approach for defining plausible futures.
This is a co-learning participatory process, that has been identified as a key
way to advance climate adaptation within organizations and processes (Hare
2020). Expertise provided by DFO Science, SEP, Indigenous groups, and other
Sectors will be integrated through this process.

Scenario planning identifies areas of high impact and low predictability
within a system, and imagines future situations, termed scenarios, that could
occur given the uncertainties identified. Large-scale driving forces that may
push the future in different directions are identified and used to uncover
potential future states. Scenarios provide a fresh perspective, and a new
framework that can be used to encourage dialogue and strategic thinking on the
challenges and opportunities we may face. It is a powerful tool for forcing us
to challenge commonly-held assumptions and expectations, and abandon
previously fixed ideas that may no longer hold true. Scenarios help by
legitimizing a dialogue, challenging conventional wisdom, initiating
widespread discussion, and creating the possibility of genuine transformation.

Participants in scenario planning processes identify and evaluate management
options or adaptations that are robust to alternate plausible future
scenarios. In this way, scenario planning can help managers understand where
management strategies may need to change to prepare for the future. This work
can also prioritize knowledge gaps and future science priorities.

Scenario planning is a flexible process that can be tailored to the specific
project goals and objectives. Generally, processes follow five steps described
by Frens and Morrison (2020): 1\. Orientation to the problem: define the
specific issue being discussed, goals, scope, and desired outcomes. 2\.
Exploration: improve understanding of the issue, identify key drivers and
uncertainties. 3\. Scenario building: identify critical uncertainties
(drivers) for the scenario framework, develop plausible scenario narratives.
4\. Application: examine scenarios for implications, develop and evaluate
management actions. 5\. Identify indicators: specifically, environmental

consequences of interbreeding of hatchery strays into non-native populations
of Chinook Salmon. Pacific salmon populations are known to display local
adaptation, such that native spawners are typically better suited to their
local habitat than non-native spawners. This can be exacerbated for strays
from populations that are integrated with hatchery enhancement, because
hatchery adaptation can further reduce fitness in natural environments.
Previous work on West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook Salmon has
demonstrated that strays from several major production facilities have
interbreed with natural populations in other rivers, resulting in
introgression of hatchery genetic variation and homogenization of population-
level variation. This work was conducted in the mid-2010s and utilized only
~12-15 genetic biomarkers, providing low density estimates of this
introgression. Low density estimates may mischaracterize the extent of
introgression, and cannot inform either the repeatability of introgression, or
the potential maladaptive consequences across different genomics regions. In
this project, we propose to update the estimates of introgression from
Robertson Creek and Conuma River Hatcheries among WCVI Chinook Salmon
populations, and to assess introgression with a high-density genomic
sequencing strategy to provide high resolution estimates of hatchery
introgression. The results of this work will inform advice processes regarding
management of hatchery strays and adaptive influences at levels above
individual populations (e.g., conservations units).

salmon in their natural habitats. However, in integrated hatchery populations,
such as those operated by the Salmonid Enhancement Program, there is typically
limited genetic differentiation between hatchery- and natural-origin spawners
as a result of gene flow between the two habitats. As a results, the genetic
variation responsible for hatchery adaptation is generally poorly resolved.
Captive brood programs maintain spawners in the hatchery environment through
their entire lifespan. This independence from natural spawners should amplify
signatures of hatchery adaptation. The objective of this project is to
leverage historical sampling of captive Sockeye Salmon broods in the Pacific
Region to characterize the genetics architecture of hatchery adaptation.
Beginning from ~2000, samples from two captive broods (Cultus and Sakinaw
Lakes) will be sequenced with high-density genomic sequencing to identify
changes in the frequencies of genetic variants throughout the duration of the
captive brood programs. These data will be paired with epigenetic sequencing
understand the contributions of DNA methylation to domestication within
captive broods, and the relationship between genetic adaptation and epigenetic
differentiation between hatchery- and natural-origin fish. These links are key
to the project as epigenetic variation between hatchery- and natural-origin
salmon is thought to play a large role in the effects of hatcheries even in
integrated populations. Finally, high-density sequencing results will be
compared with parallel low-density assessments of genetic variation in the
captive broods to validate the performance of low-density markers in assessing
and monitoring genetic diversity through time in captive brood and populations
of conservation concern.

In extreme cases
of these declines, local populations are at the risk of extirpation, which may
suggest intervention through the introduction of spawners from non-native
populations (i.e., transplants), which is sometimes termed &quot;genetic rescue&quot;.
Transplanted spawners can provide a demographic boost to declining
populations; however, Chinook Salmon display local adaptation, such that non-
native spawners may be less fit than native spawners, posing a genetic risk to
the native population. Additionally, interbreeding between populations has the
potential to expression genetic incompatibilities between populations that
also cause a loss of fitness (i.e., outbreeding depression). The consequences
of outbreeding in Chinook Salmon are poorly understood, and are highly
relevant to best practices for transplantation/genetic rescue. The objectives
of the proposed project is to collect gametes from four populations of Chinook
salmon displaying a range of genetic differentiation, conduct artificial
crosses within and among populations, and assess the hatching success and
physiological performance of the offspring from these crosses. We hypothesize
that negative outcomes of interbreeding are proportional to the genetic
differentiation among populations. A key question addressed by this experiment
will be whether or not interbreeding within a conservation unit produces
negative fitness outcomes.

crucial to determine the Proportionate Natural Influence (PNI) of a stock.
Used to support planning of hatchery activities, allocation of fishing effort
and research on stock composition, PNI is calculated by combining a number of
potential data sources including genetics, coded wire tags, thermal otolith
marks or fin clip recoveries, depending on the availability of data for
different stocks. Rapid calculation of PNI is currently confounded by a number
of factors including lack of managed data sources, varied analysis processes,
and disconnects between fisheries, escapement and hatchery data sources. This
project will identify the main barriers to determining PNI, develop a proof of
concept data pipeline and highlight where effort at building data management
and analysis pipelines will provide greatest benefit. The work will center on
two priority areas: Priority 1: Broodstock PBT database: Routine access to PBT
results is a known barrier for SEP staff. This project component will develop
methods for enabling SEP to access them in a timely manner and suitable
format. Deliverables: 1) Process map showing the PBT results needed by SEP
staff, current blockers to access and what their needs are for ongoing/routine
access 2) Develop proof of concept PBT data results pipeline and portal in
collaboration with MGL (in EPro, data lakehouse, github or other) Priority 2:
PNI Calculation Pipeline: Building on the understanding of PBT data processes,
this component will map the various systems and data sources used to calculate
PNI, then propose a standardized decision-tree system using multiple data
sources and based on SEP PNI calculation guidelines. Deliverables: 1) Compile
SEP knowledge on PNI calculation steps 2) Map the blockers and opportunities
for formalizing these steps in a data pipeline 3) Implement a proof of concept
PNI calculation pipeline in DFO’s cloud environment.
