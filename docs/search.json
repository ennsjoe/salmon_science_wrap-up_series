This modelling project studies the relationships between salmon survival and environmental data in freshwater and marine habitats, then applies those relationships to more specific stocks with less available information. By modelling these relationships across all salmon stocks, decision-makers are better able to predict the state of salmon stocks under a variety of climate change scenarios."

Historically, heart and chevron shaped traps were used extensively by First Nation communities along the estuary to capture adult salmon prior to the development of commercial fisheries. Recent revitalization of fish traps as a terminal fishery in other areas along the coast has been shown to be successfully at catching and selectively harvest hatchery marked salmon species while releasing wild (unmarked) salmon and steelhead of conservation concern. Partnering with We Wai Kai First Nation, Wei Wai Kum First Nation, LGL Limited, and the Wild Fish Conservancy; the initiative will develop First Nations’ capacity for sustainable salmon stewardship through the development of the best selective harvest fishing methods possible in traditional fishing areas while preserving wild stocks of conservation concern."

The project components will thus provide proximate empirical data on the environmental conditions of salmon habitats, salmon stress, growth, and immune responses to their stream environments, as well as population level relationships from salmon and forestry timeseries. The outcomes of the project will provide detailed histories of forestry and salmon in the watersheds of Musgamagw Dzawada’enuxw territory, new fieldwork with which to analyze how forestry practices and history interact with climate change to affect salmon, and a quantitative analysis of salmon population responses to forestry histories across the full British Columbia coast."

    "text": "Species Group: Pacific Salmon\nLocation: Broughton Archipelago.\nPartners: None listed\nAgreement Period: March 07, 4610301 to October 07, 4861522\nOrganization: Salmon Coast Field Station Society\nSession(s): Freshwater Stressors\nPresentation Date(s): December 02, 2025\nSpeakers: Maria Kuruvilla\nAbstract:\nThe project will be four components (i) provide a quantitative and qualitative history of forestry and salmon in Musgamagw Dzawada’enuxw territory, (ii) quantify the effects of forest harvesting histories on salmon abundance for all Pacific salmon species in coastal BC, (iii) establish a temperature, sedimentation, and dissolved oxygen monitoring system in salmon watersheds of Musgamagw Dzawada’enuxw territory to quantify stream temperatures and water quality in relation to forestry activity and support a centralized database of stream temperatures coast-wide initiated by the PSF, and (iv) develop a new non-invasive method for studying salmon stress responses using environmental DNA technology and applies it to salmon in relation to temperature and environmental variation across watersheds in Musgamagw Dzawada’enuxw territory. The project components will thus provide proximate empirical data on the environmental conditions of salmon habitats, salmon stress, growth, and immune responses to their stream environments, as well as population level relationships from salmon and forestry timeseries. The outcomes of the project will provide detailed histories of forestry and salmon in the watersheds of Musgamagw Dzawada’enuxw territory, new fieldwork with which to analyze how forestry practices and history interact with climate change to affect salmon, and a quantitative analysis of salmon population responses to forestry histories across the full British Columbia coast."

Juvenile Chinook habitat use and risk from predators has not been well studied and may be key factors regarding climate change, invasive species, and restoration efforts. This population study hires graduate students to research juvenile Okanagan Chinook and track survival through tagging."

The technical approach revealed annual shifts in stress, infection, and timing of smolt readiness. Future monitoring of pathogens in hatchery source water is crucial to minimize infection potential and maximize post-release survival in stocks of conservation concern."
