We will use PIT-tagging to estimate survival, and combine these estimates with individual-based measures of environmental stress using cutting-edge gene-expression tools (“Fit-Chips”). Additionally, we will monitor environmental DNA (eDNA) to determine key rearing habitats, availability of prey, and presence of predators and pathogens across spatial and temporal scales.\nOur project will fill key information gaps pertaining to at-risk Chinook populations, prescribed for rebuilding under the Fisheries Act. Ultimately, the findings will help to inform targeted habitat restoration, protection, and enhancement efforts for WCVI Chinook salmon. Adding to ongoing collaborations with WCVI First Nations, DFO, local NGOs, and PSF’s Salmon Bottlenecks project, we will leverage extensive experience, expertise, and infrastructure already in place to deliver the most comprehensive investigation to date of early marine survival in WCVI Chinook salmon."

However, some anglers prefer fishing for smallmouth bass and strongly oppose actions to lower the bass population. This predator research study captures (electrofrishing), tags (PIT and acoustic transmitters), and biosamples smallmouth bass to assess population control methods and interviews anglers to develop a community plan."

The project components will thus provide proximate empirical data on the environmental conditions of salmon habitats, salmon stress, growth, and immune responses to their stream environments, as well as population level relationships from salmon and forestry timeseries. The outcomes of the project will provide detailed histories of forestry and salmon in the watersheds of Musgamagw Dzawada’enuxw territory, new fieldwork with which to analyze how forestry practices and history interact with climate change to affect salmon, and a quantitative analysis of salmon population responses to forestry histories across the full British Columbia coast."

The project components will thus provide proximate empirical data on the environmental conditions of salmon habitats, salmon stress, growth, and immune responses to their stream environments, as well as population level relationships from salmon and forestry timeseries. The outcomes of the project will provide detailed histories of forestry and salmon in the watersheds of Musgamagw Dzawada’enuxw territory, new fieldwork with which to analyze how forestry practices and history interact with climate change to affect salmon, and a quantitative analysis of salmon population responses to forestry histories across the full British Columbia coast."
