This monitoring project samples juvenile Chinook during year-round salmon surveys in estuarine and marine waters along the WCVI. Researchers are characterizing fish distribution and health (condition, diet, growth) to understanding what factors may be limiting early marine survival.\nActivities:\nNot Listed"

Have smaller phytoplankton replaced diatoms, lengthening the food chain and making food less nutritious for salmon? This study uses chemical markers in sediment cores and water samples to investigate food web changes in BC coastal inlets.\nActivities:\nNot Listed"
