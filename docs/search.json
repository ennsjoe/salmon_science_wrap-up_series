    "text": "Lead(s): Kristi Miller-Saunders\nDivision: Aquatic Diagnostics, Genomics and Technology (ADGT)\nSection: Molecular Genetics\nPSSI Pillar: 1-Conservation and stewardship\nSpeaker Theme: Follow the Fish: Life Cycle Monitoring of WCVI Chinook\nPresentation: December 03, 2025\nOverview:\nSalmon experience a variety of physiological stressors and pathogens over migration which can be monitored non-lethally using Fit-Chip technology. Chinook salmon will expose themselves to potentially impactful stressors to avail feeding opportunities, enhancing vulnerability to cumulative stressors. eDNA data resolves habitat usage for Chinook salmon and demonstrating they associate with high biomass areas (prey availability), including aquaculture facilities, and avoid harmful algae. Models addressing the cumulative and synergistic interplay between factors will inform which levers under human control will result in strongest outcomes for salmon.\nActivities:\nPreliminary Fit-Chip analysis of WCVI microtroll and purse seine caught juvenile Chinook salmon (project years 2023-2024) suggests several factors that may be limiting the health and survival of early marine Chinook salmon, most notably: high water temperature, hypoxia stress, harmful algae and infectious agents . In 2025-2026 we will target these factors for detailed spatiotemporal analysis and conduct analyses connecting Fit-Chip and eDNA data as described in the following objectives:\n\nFit-Chip analysis of microtroll collected Chinook indicated a much higher prevalence of hypoxia stress in the wild than anticipated based on the laboratory challenge studies where extremely low levels of oxygen were required to elicit a stress response. Initial results indicate that hypoxia signals were strong at inlet heads where previous oceanographic studies have identified low oxygen levels in corresponding seasons. Spatio-temporal models, an early version of which identified the aforementioned signal, will be further developed to include other potential sources of hypoxia stress, including gill pathogens and harmful algal blooms (HABs), the presence of which can be determined by eDNA. We are collaborating with DFO specialists working on HABs in WCVI to build a multifactorial model (Andrew Ross et al.).\nPrevalence and infection density of Tenacibaculum maritimum in Fit-Chip data from purse seine collected Chinook salmon exceeded levels previously observed in any field study (molecular or otherwise) of wild salmonids (close to 100% prevalence on some sampling days). This bacterium has been found to cause rapid mortality in salmonids and has been negatively associated with population-level survival in BC Chinook salmon. It is a common cause of salmon health events in BC netpen aquaculture and is elevated in the water around active pens. We observed T. maritimum detections in more northerly sounds sampled in the fall, coincident with detections in eDNA associated with aquaculture. An ongoing sequence-based epidemiology study will determine whether T. maritimum strains vary between sounds or there is some level of connectivity between sounds. We will also conduct statistical analyses to check for associations between T. maritimum and the many physiological, morphological, and clinical variables in our dataset. Additionally, we may be able to compare T. maritimum levels to CPUE data (or perhaps acoustic monitoring data). For this infectious agent, and other high ranking pathogens run on Fit-Chips, we will check for correlations with corresponding eDNA measurements and the aforementioned metrics of fish health. Another agent, Paranucleospora theridion, which has previously demonstrated associations with aquaculture and sea lice, appeared at much higher frequency in Clayoquot Sound relative to other inlets. Like T. maritimum, P. theridion was statistically associated with Atlantic salmon detections in eDNA samples. We will employ multiple statistical approaches to test for a relationship between this pathogen and aquaculture, including models of infestation pressure and distance to active netpens. The same approach could be applied to other agents where a biological mechanism is expected. Agents of particular interest are Atlantic salmon calicivirus, Cutthroat trout virus-2, Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi, Tenacibaculum finmarkense, and Piscirickettsia salmonis, all of which were positively associated with Atlantic salmon eDNA detections and thus aquaculture.\nMGL has recently developed a starvation panel for use on the Fit-Chip that determines when fish present gene expression signals indicating food deprivation. As starvation was a primary hypothesized driver coming out of the WCVI Chinook marine risk assessment process, we will apply this new panel on select samples to identify spatio-temporal patterns in starvation. We will compare Fit-Chip starvation data to stomach sample analysis (Bokvist et al.), eDNA data characterizing salmon prey distribution (Gauthier et al.), and plankton data (Sastri et al.). Together, this data should allow us to identify spatiotemporal hotspots of good and poor dietary conditions for juvenile salmon.\nWhile thermal stress was not detected in microtroll samples collected from October through May across years (as expected), there was a strong thermal stress signal detected in Barkley purse seine collected Chinook in 2022 (as hypothesized during the WCVI Chinook risk assessment process). 2023 and 2024 purse seine samples will be run on Fit-Chips to determine whether this pattern is consistent across years. In order to understand potential impacts to wild stocks, additional sampling of fish and eDNA from more northerly sounds (i.e. Nootka and Kyuquot) during July and August would be beneficial in 2025. Statistical analyses will be conducted to identify other stressors, including pathogens, that are associated with exposure to high water temperatures (HWT). Through the use of eDNA data, this analysis will also explore how salmon ecosystems change with increasing SST in order to inform changing ecosystem dynamics under climate change\nNext to the above mentioned observations, eDNA analysis was able to provide coarse spatiotemporal distribution patterns for all pacific salmon, as well as cutthroat trout, steelhead and Dolly Varden, that largely agreed with the spatiotemporal distribution of salmonids from microtrolling data. In total, eDNA metabarcoding was able to identifying 1146 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from viruses and bacteria, algae, zooplankton, nekton, salmonids, to marine mammals including whales, highlighting the complexity and diversity of the marine ecosystems of WCVI. Preliminary network analysis indicates ecosystem wide changes associated with aquaculture, as Atlantic salmon detections correlated with the presence of several HABs, microorganisms like amoebas, algae, cnidarians, bryozoans and numerous benthic polychaetes. This could potentially be related to nutrient loading by aquaculture., a hypothesis we will investigate in 2025/2026. Strikingly, aquaculture was also associated with forage fish and predators, including steelhead, coho, Dolly Varden, cutthroat, and Chinook, suggesting that salmonids with extended coastal life histories are attracted to high biomass areas such as aquaculture sites. Chinook showed a strong aversion to HABs that were not associated with aquaculture, but no such relationship was observed with aquaculture associated HABs. In 2025/2026 we will investigate whether Chinook risk exposure to HABs in order to avail themselves of the feeding opportunities associated with aquaculture facilities. For 2025-2026, we will shift our focus into continued sampling of Barkley, Nootka, and Kyuquot Sounds in order to be able to compare northern and southern Sounds with different oceanographic features and anthropogenic impacts. Analysis will focus on detailed spatiotemporal breakdown of shifts in habitat usage by Chinook and the underlying changes in ecosystem composition in an attempt to identify the drivers of fish health events identified by Fit-Chips.\nIt is expected that in the third year of PSSI, stock assessment will provide an additional modeler to work collaboratively with Bass, Llewellyn, Deeg, and possibly others to build the most comprehensive, data-driven modeling to address the cumulative and synergistic interplay between key factors undermining salmon condition and survival identified in the WCVI Chinook Marine Risk Assessments, including prey availability, environmental stress (climate and anthropogenic), pathogens, toxicants/harmful algae, predators, competition, and freshwater carryover effects.\n\n⬅ Back to Home"

    "text": "Lead(s): Amy Long\nDivision: Aquatic Diagnostics, Genomics and Technology (ADGT)\nSection: Aquatic Animal Health\nPSSI Pillar: 2-Salmon enhancement\nSpeaker Theme: Fish health\nPresentation: December 09, 2025\nOverview:\nSalmon disease testing methods have greatly expanded in the last decade resulting in increased accuracy and decreased turnaround time; implementation of these tests will increase the Finfish Diagnostic Laboratory’s diagnostic capacity. This hatchery lab project collects tissue samples from broodstock and young salmon to confirm new methods are sensitive and specific to pathogens of interest. Once validated, these tests will be used by the Finfish Diagnostic Laboratory.\nActivities:\nObjective 1. Optimization and validation of non-lethal screening methods for detection of Renibacterium salmoninarum in Chinook Salmon broodstock. Development of a protocol for non-lethal detection of Renibacterium salmoninarum in broodstock was initiated in Year 2. For this work, non-lethal samples (anal fin, gill clip, mucus, and anal swab) as well as kidney were collected from Chinook salmon broodstock in Fall 2024. Samples are currently being screened by qPCR and ELISA (kidney only) with results expected by the end of this fiscal year. In Year 3, we will analyze these results to determine assay agreement and which non-lethal sample is most appropriate.\nAssay validation, including determination of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, will be completed in Year 3. To do so, samples will be collected from apparently healthy salmon held in the Brett Aquarium at PBS, spiked with R. salmoninarum nucleic acid, and diagnostic specificity and sensitivity determined. In Fall 2025, we will screen broodstock samples from multiple stocks at three to four facilities and compare molecular and ELISA results.\nIf the non-lethal samples lack sensitivity as compared to ELISA (the gold standard), then a meeting will be held with SEP managers to determine the needs of the organization with regards to non-lethal sampling (diagnostic thresholds, invasiveness, etc.) and potential avenues for further research.\nThe results of this work will be provided to SEP in the form of a report as well as a presentation if desired.\nObjective 2. Continued longitudinal surveillance of select stocks. Targeted screening of healthy and diseased fish from SEP hatcheries and/or spawning channels will continue in Year 3. Pathogens of interest include Flavobacterium columnare, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, R. salmoninarum, and F. psychrophilum. The majority of the testing effort will focus on the latter two as these are enzootic bacteria that have a significant negative impact on salmonid health. At the end of Year 3, an internal report on pathogen distribution, prevalence, and infection level will be prepared for distribution to SEP. Additionally, as all samples being screened for R. salmoninarum by our qPCR assay are also being screened by ELISA, a preliminary estimate of assay agreement will be prepared.\nObjective 3. Implementation of next generation sequencing pipelines for identification of unknown microorganisms. Samples (whole fish, tissue, or ovarian fluid) submitted to FDL are screened for pathogens using traditional diagnostic techniques (histology and bacterial/viral culture) or molecular assays. However, it is not uncommon to re-isolate microorganisms that cannot be identified using standard methodologies.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Lead(s): Amy Long\nDivision: Aquatic Diagnostics, Genomics and Technology (ADGT)\nSection: Aquatic Animal Health\nPSSI Pillar: 2-Salmon enhancement\nSpeaker Theme: Fish health\nPresentation: December 09, 2025\nOverview:\nSalmon disease testing methods have greatly expanded in the last decade resulting in increased accuracy and decreased turnaround time; implementation of these tests will increase the Finfish Diagnostic Laboratory’s diagnostic capacity. This hatchery lab project collects tissue samples from broodstock and young salmon to confirm new methods are sensitive and specific to pathogens of interest. Once validated, these tests will be used by the Finfish Diagnostic Laboratory.\nActivities:\nObjective 1. Optimization and validation of non-lethal screening methods for detection of Renibacterium salmoninarum in Chinook Salmon broodstock. Development of a protocol for non-lethal detection of Renibacterium salmoninarum in broodstock was initiated in Year 2. For this work, non-lethal samples (anal fin, gill clip, mucus, and anal swab) as well as kidney were collected from Chinook salmon broodstock in Fall 2024. Samples are currently being screened by qPCR and ELISA (kidney only) with results expected by the end of this fiscal year. In Year 3, we will analyze these results to determine assay agreement and which non-lethal sample is most appropriate.\nAssay validation, including determination of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, will be completed in Year 3. To do so, samples will be collected from apparently healthy salmon held in the Brett Aquarium at PBS, spiked with R. salmoninarum nucleic acid, and diagnostic specificity and sensitivity determined. In Fall 2025, we will screen broodstock samples from multiple stocks at three to four facilities and compare molecular and ELISA results.\nIf the non-lethal samples lack sensitivity as compared to ELISA (the gold standard), then a meeting will be held with SEP managers to determine the needs of the organization with regards to non-lethal sampling (diagnostic thresholds, invasiveness, etc.) and potential avenues for further research.\nThe results of this work will be provided to SEP in the form of a report as well as a presentation if desired.\nObjective 2. Continued longitudinal surveillance of select stocks. Targeted screening of healthy and diseased fish from SEP hatcheries and/or spawning channels will continue in Year 3. Pathogens of interest include Flavobacterium columnare, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, R. salmoninarum, and F. psychrophilum. The majority of the testing effort will focus on the latter two as these are enzootic bacteria that have a significant negative impact on salmonid health. At the end of Year 3, an internal report on pathogen distribution, prevalence, and infection level will be prepared for distribution to SEP. Additionally, as all samples being screened for R. salmoninarum by our qPCR assay are also being screened by ELISA, a preliminary estimate of assay agreement will be prepared.\nObjective 3. Implementation of next generation sequencing pipelines for identification of unknown microorganisms. Samples (whole fish, tissue, or ovarian fluid) submitted to FDL are screened for pathogens using traditional diagnostic techniques (histology and bacterial/viral culture) or molecular assays. However, it is not uncommon to re-isolate microorganisms that cannot be identified using standard methodologies. In Year 3, we will use Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), a next generation sequencing (NGS) platform, to identify archived unknown agents of interest. For bacterial agents, the raw 16S ribosomal DNA sequences obtained from the Nanopore platform will be analyzed by the wf-16s pipeline in the EPI2ME program curated by ONT.

This fish health monitoring study gathers Chinook tissue samples from the Albion test fishery and hatcheries to measure thiamine, fatty acids, and other health parameters to help predict and monitor vulnerable stocks.\nActivities:\nYear 3 – manuscript writing, CSAS advisory document, workshop to report back to Clients, final data package release.\n⬅ Back to Home"
