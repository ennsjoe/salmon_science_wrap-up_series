    "text": "Lead(s): Tom Bird\nDivision: Stock Assessment and Research (StAR)\nSection: Fishery and Assessment Data\nLocation: N/A\nStatus: New\nTheme: Unspecified\nPSSI Pillar: Unspecified\nOverview:\nDetermining the hatchery contribution to fisheries catch and escapement is crucial to determine the Proportionate Natural Influence (PNI) of a stock. Used to support planning of hatchery activities, allocation of fishing effort and research on stock composition, PNI is calculated by combining a number of potential data sources including genetics, coded wire tags, thermal otolith marks or fin clip recoveries, depending on the availability of data for different stocks. Rapid calculation of PNI is currently confounded by a number of factors including lack of managed data sources, varied analysis processes, and disconnects between fisheries, escapement and hatchery data sources. This project will identify the main barriers to determining PNI, develop a proof of concept data pipeline and highlight where effort at building data management and analysis pipelines will provide greatest benefit. The work will center on two priority areas: Priority 1: Broodstock PBT database: Routine access to PBT results is a known barrier for SEP staff. This project component will develop methods for enabling SEP to access them in a timely manner and suitable format. Deliverables: 1) Process map showing the PBT results needed by SEP staff, current blockers to access and what their needs are for ongoing/routine access 2) Develop proof of concept PBT data results pipeline and portal in collaboration with MGL (in EPro, data lakehouse, github or other) Priority 2: PNI Calculation Pipeline: Building on the understanding of PBT data processes, this component will map the various systems and data sources used to calculate PNI, then propose a standardized decision-tree system using multiple data sources and based on SEP PNI calculation guidelines. Deliverables: 1) Compile SEP knowledge on PNI calculation steps 2) Map the blockers and opportunities for formalizing these steps in a data pipeline 3) Implement a proof of concept PNI calculation pipeline in DFO’s cloud environment.\n⬅ Back to Home"

However, in integrated hatchery populations, such as those operated by the Salmonid Enhancement Program, there is typically limited genetic differentiation between hatchery- and natural-origin spawners as a result of gene flow between the two habitats. As a results, the genetic variation responsible for hatchery adaptation is generally poorly resolved. Captive brood programs maintain spawners in the hatchery environment through their entire lifespan. This independence from natural spawners should amplify signatures of hatchery adaptation. The objective of this project is to leverage historical sampling of captive Sockeye Salmon broods in the Pacific Region to characterize the genetics architecture of hatchery adaptation. Beginning from ~2000, samples from two captive broods (Cultus and Sakinaw Lakes) will be sequenced with high-density genomic sequencing to identify changes in the frequencies of genetic variants throughout the duration of the captive brood programs. These data will be paired with epigenetic sequencing understand the contributions of DNA methylation to domestication within captive broods, and the relationship between genetic adaptation and epigenetic differentiation between hatchery- and natural-origin fish. These links are key to the project as epigenetic variation between hatchery- and natural-origin salmon is thought to play a large role in the effects of hatcheries even in integrated populations. Finally, high-density sequencing results will be compared with parallel low-density assessments of genetic variation in the captive broods to validate the performance of low-density markers in assessing and monitoring genetic diversity through time in captive brood and populations of conservation concern.\n⬅ Back to Home"

How do hatchery managers move forward despite these uncertainties and overcome “management paralysis” in the context of climate change?\nWhat is being proposed: We will use scenario planning to develop insight into how SEP/DFO can better ensure that hatchery planning and implementation is adaptable to climate change impacts over the next 20 years. Year 1 will focus on a DFO internal process and plan for broader engagement in Year 2 with Indigenous knowledge experts.\nScenario planning enables organizations to embrace uncertainty by expanding their understanding of the plausible range of futures they may experience. Scenarios are meant to guide and inform organizations about potential future changes that will impact how they operate. These processes enable organizations to be better positioned to deal with unexpected threats, and take advantage of unexpected opportunities.\nScenario planning is a structured approach for defining plausible futures. This is a co-learning participatory process, that has been identified as a key way to advance climate adaptation within organizations and processes (Hare 2020). Expertise provided by DFO Science, SEP, Indigenous groups, and other Sectors will be integrated through this process.\nScenario planning identifies areas of high impact and low predictability within a system, and imagines future situations, termed scenarios, that could occur given the uncertainties identified. Large-scale driving forces that may push the future in different directions are identified and used to uncover potential future states. Scenarios provide a fresh perspective, and a new framework that can be used to encourage dialogue and strategic thinking on the challenges and opportunities we may face. It is a powerful tool for forcing us to challenge commonly-held assumptions and expectations, and abandon previously fixed ideas that may no longer hold true. Scenarios help by legitimizing a dialogue, challenging conventional wisdom, initiating widespread discussion, and creating the possibility of genuine transformation.\nParticipants in scenario planning processes identify and evaluate management options or adaptations that are robust to alternate plausible future scenarios. In this way, scenario planning can help managers understand where management strategies may need to change to prepare for the future. This work can also prioritize knowledge gaps and future science priorities.\nScenario planning is a flexible process that can be tailored to the specific project goals and objectives. Generally, processes follow five steps described by Frens and Morrison (2020): 1. Orientation to the problem: define the specific issue being discussed, goals, scope, and desired outcomes. 2. Exploration: improve understanding of the issue, identify key drivers and uncertainties. 3. Scenario building: identify critical uncertainties (drivers) for the scenario framework, develop plausible scenario narratives. 4. Application: examine scenarios for implications, develop and evaluate management actions. 5. Identify indicators: specifically, environmental indicators and thresholds that would trigger recommended management strategies.\nCollaboration with another ESD-SEP PSSI Proposal: this work links with ESD proposal led by Chrys Neville: “Assessing the impact of modifications to hatchery release strategies of Chinook salmon on their distribution and marine survival’ though engaging scientific expertise and knowledge that can support scenario planning process to identify hatchery adaptation robust to future climate change scenarios.\n⬅ Back to Home"

Oceanographers in DFO and other departments such as ECCC have collaborated in the development of ocean models that can be used to assess future changes in the environment for salmon and other fish species. However, there is a significant 'scale gap' between the global, coarse resolution Earth System Models used to generate climate projections and the high-resolution (e.g., 3 km) models used to downscale these projections for coastal and shelf environments. This gap can be filled by basin-scale models at 1/12 to 1/4 degree.

In this way we will create an 'envelope of possibilities' of future environments for salmon in the oceanic environment.\nThe main anticipated outcomes from this work are (1) development of a capacity to downscale climate projections at intermediate scale, including biogeochemistry (e.g., oxygen concentration), and (2) generation of data products that can used for Species Distribution Modelling of salmon in the oceanic environment.\n⬅ Back to Home"

    "text": "Lead(s): Chrys Neville\nDivision: Ecosystem Sciences (ESD)\nSection: Regional Ecosystems Effects on Fish and Fisheries\nLocation: N/A\nStatus: Not funded\nTheme: Unspecified\nPSSI Pillar: Unspecified\nOverview:\nThe commercial chum fishery in British Columbia has collapsed. The fishery, that averaged about 15,000 t between 1950-1989, declined sharply since 2010 and in 2022 was only 180 t. The catch in 2023 appears to be as low or lower. In addition to the collapse of the fishery, there is a collapse of escapements. Atlas et al (2022) reported an 80-90% collapse in spawning chum salmon abundance in Central Coast rivers since 1960. The Fraser River, historically the largest producer of Chum salmon in BC, may not reach targeted escapement for 2023 despite not allowing any fishing. Additionally, targeted chum escapements for numerous other rivers flowing into the Strait of Georgia appear to be alarmingly low in 2023. These declines in chum salmon are as equally, or even more alarming, as the collapse of southern BC coho salmon escapements in the 1990s that resulted in the closure of key fisheries. The dramatic declines of chum salmon have not only impacted commercial fisheries, historically the most important salmon fishery by weight in BC, but declines have significant implications to First Nations. Additionally, Hanson et al (2001) demonstrated that chum salmon were 2 to 3 times more important in the diet than Chinook salmon during the fall and early winter for “southern resident killer whales” adding an additional concern for the protection of southern resident killer whales.\nThe reasons for the declines in chum salmon are not understood and not studied. We have 25 years of juvenile chum catches in the Strait of Georgia and three years of catches of British Columbia chum salmon in the winter in the Gulf of Alaska that we can use to develop hypotheses to explain why declines are occurring and what might be done to manage existing populations to maximize future production as ocean ecosystems change.\nThere is no trend in the catches of juvenile chum salmon in the juvenile salmon surveys conducted by the Salmon Marine Interactions Program in the Strait of Georgia for the past 25 years indicating that the number of juveniles entering the ocean has not declined. However, there has been no stock specific DNA analysis completed for the juvenile chum salmon catches in these surveys in the Strait of Georgia because funds were not available. Surveys in the Gulf of Alaska in the winter of 2019, 2020 and 2020 were the first studies of Canadian chum salmon during the winter. DNA and age analysis indicated that although Canadian chum salmon in their first winter in the ocean were encountered, there were very few Canadian chum salmon in their 2nd, 3rd or 4th winters. However, these older age classes were encountered for chum salmon that originated from Alaska, Russia and Japan. Therefore, results from the winter expeditions and results from the juvenile salmon surveys suggest that recent declines occur before or about the time of the first ocean winter.\nThis project will produce stock specific juvenile abundances of chum salmon in the summer and fall survey catches in the Strait of Georgia. These abundances will be used to determine if there are stock specific trends in abundance over the 25 years of sampling or stock specific patterns of juveniles remaining in the Strait of Georgia through their first marine summer. The stock specific abundances will also be compared to the stock composition of chum in the catches from our winter surveys in the Gulf of Alaska. Resulting relationships with survey abundance trends, escapements, hatchery production, stock specific growth and condition will be used to develop hypotheses for possible causes of the decline in ocean survival of BC chum salmon and what can be done to maximize survival in the future of changing ocean ecosystems.\nLiterature cited:\nAtlas, W.I., K.L.

    "title": "Improved understanding of cumulative impacts on salmon survival across freshwater life-stages; tools and approaches for mechanistic assessments",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Lead(s): David Patterson, Douglas Braun\nDivision: Ecosystem Sciences (ESD)\nSection: Freshwater Ecosystems\nLocation: [“Thompson”]\nStatus: Ongoing\nTheme: Threat Assessment and Mitigation\nPSSI Pillar: 1-Conservation and stewardship\nOverview:\nContext: Landscape level assessments of stressors on aquatic habitats, climate change projections, and population dynamics models can provide cautionary flags that identify potentially stressed or vulnerable watersheds and/or populations (e.g., RPA status assessment, Pacific Salmon Explorer). These approaches are useful for initial watershed or population prioritization. However, in most cases these approaches are limited in their ability to accurately describe the cumulative impact that multiple stressors can have on individuals and specific populations because they lack a mechanistic approach that can verify the complex interacting pathways of effects on fish (Peacock, Braun, Hodgson et al., 2023). This complexity makes it difficult to understand how future landscape alterations and climate change will affect salmon in a given watershed; thus limiting our ability to provide specific advice to managers on how to predict which mitigation or recovery actions (e.g. habitat restoration, harvest reductions) will most effectively recover salmon populations. We propose to link in situ ecophysiology information with other biophysical habitat monitoring data to develop mechanistic relationships that address management issues around habitat-population modeling, assessment of restoration function, and fish responses to climate change. The specific management questions are: Q1) What multi-factor stressors limit stage specific freshwater habitat distribution? Q2) What are the key drivers of stage- specific survival and growth for life-cycle modelling? Q3) What is the role of temperature in combination with other key factors in predicting climate change impacts on salmon growth and survival in a given habitat (e.g. lake, river, wetlands)? Q4) What are major habitat factors that affect salmon growth and survival to consider in planning and assessment of habitat mitigation, restoration, and offsetting effectiveness? The proposal is to execute a series of projects that directly address these management questions through two main outcomes 1) improved understanding of cumulative effects, and co-development of 2) tools and approaches to guide future mechanistic assessments of cumulative impacts. Improve Understanding: For year 1 & 2, we propose to continue work on cumulative impact projects: 1) development of in situ stage specific mechanistic relationships among biophysical factors (dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, flow, conspecific competition), distribution, physiological condition metrics, growth, and survival for juvenile salmonids – all measure in situ, 2) continue to develop and evaluate ecophysiology tools related to evaluating fish condition. Life-stage specific mechanistic relationships will be examined using samples in-hand from three large scale field programs (Lakes, E-Watch, North Thompson Salmon Ecosystem Program) within the Freshwater Ecosystems Section. All three programs generate unique multi-year population data on multiple biophysical factors influencing juvenile salmon condition, growth, and survival such as, water quality, conspecific density, temperature, food availability, primary productivity, DO and water level in lakes, wetlands, and flows in rivers. Models examining the effects of multiple biophysical factors on condition will be used to understand how interacting biophysical drivers (including stressors) shape fish condition, while models examining relationships between condition metrics and growth and/or survival will examine the use of condition metrics as tools to indicate future salmon presence, growth and survival. Concomitant lab work is ongoing to support the development of ecophysiology tools, such as growth hormones (IgF) for freshwater salmon growth, troponin for oxygen stress, and triglycerides (TAG) for nutritional status, that can be used as potential indicators of habitat quality. For Year 3&4 we will use the results from year 1&2 to identify and test key knowledge gaps on cumulative effects in salmon (e.g. Iacarella proposal). This selection of multifactor field experiments could include: low DO and high temperature; food availability, temperature, and growth/survival; pH and temperature tolerance experiments with preference/avoidance behaviour studies; and temperature and migratory stressors on in-river survival Sockeye/Chinook/Coho. This project is distinct from related PSSI proposals in that we are proposing a mechanistic approach to test the cumulative impact of multiple factors directly on individual fish response (i.e. growth, survival, stress) in their native habitats, leveraging multiple program expertise both within the freshwater section and beyond. Our experience is that science advice to major management decisions are best supported by a mechanistic understanding how environmental and physiological processes directly impact fish themselves. This is foundational work that can then be used to generate population responses were appropriate. However, we acknowledge that not all management questions to science require such an in-depth experimental approach, which is why we are proposing the guideline development to help managers and researchers prioritize how best to approach assessing cumulative impacts, as well as work with the other related projects. The proposal is complementary to other PSSI science proposals in that we are addressing similar questions, but at different spatial scales (e.g. Iacarella’s broad region-wide scale) and biological levels of organization. The work also complements broad-scale modeled predictions of discharge, temperature, and DO, that can be used with our mechanistic relationships to generate robust predictions of fish responses to climate change. More specifically, we will help test some of key stressor interactions that emerge as pervasive across the province from Iacarells’s proposal with field-based studies. We will directly link the outputs from Naman’s model of habitat suitability with direct measures of fish condition, fish performance and survival (i.e. a form of cross validation). We will work with Czembor’s group to share ideas on the state of knowledge of key limiting factors, and evaluate fit-chips as a potential ecophysiological tool from the Miller proposal. Tools and Approaches: We will synthesize approaches and our results to develop a pragmatic guide for initiating mechanistic cumulative effects investigations. We started with a literature review (Y1-2) of current methods for assessing physiological condition, as an integrated measure of habitat quality. The review will examine the benefits and limitations of these different physiological condition metrics and span metrics that include genomic, transcriptomic (fitchips), proteins (e.g. hormones, enzymes), metabolites (TAGs, ions), and phenotypes (size). This verification of physiological tools will be done in conjunction with assessing different habitat monitoring and modelling approaches (e.g. Cunningham 2022; Naman proposal) to verify Value of Information. For Year 3 & 4. The culmination of the literature review and field/lab projects will be a pragmatic guide for a tiered approach (i.e. opinions, reviews, observations, hypothesis testing, quantification of uncertainty) to initiate mechanistic cumulative effects investigations that directly link to management advice (Patterson et al. 2016). The guide can be used to develop in-depth monitoring programs where watersheds or populations are flagged by broad scale analyses as stressed or at risk (Iacarella proposal).\n⬅ Back to Home"

    "title": "Genetic associations with age of return in male Canadian Chinook Salmon",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Lead(s): Eric Rondeau, Tim Healy, Kyle Wellband\nDivision: Aquatic Diagnostics, Genomics and Technology (ADGT)\nSection: Molecular Genetics\nLocation: [“Chilliwack River”,“Puntledge River”,“Qualicum River”]\nStatus: Ongoing\nTheme: Innovation & Diagnostics\nPSSI Pillar: 2-Salmon enhancement\nOverview:\nChinook Salmon display arguably the widest range of life history strategies of all Pacific salmonids. One important life history strategy in male Chinooks is to return after one fewer year in the marine environment than the earliest returning females. These early-returning males or “jacks” are relatively small, and participate in spawning by employing an opportunistic “sneaker” strategy to fertilize small numbers of eggs from many spawning events involving females and larger, more dominant, males. In general, spawning success in Chinook Salmon is closely related to size; however, jacks experience the risk marine predation for at least one less year than other males, and the success of jacks is a product of negative frequency-dependent selection. In other words, as the proportion of large males increases, the relative success of jacks increases, whereas as the proportion of jacks increases, the relative success of jacks decreases. In addition, from an evolutionary perspective jack males represent an important natural avenue of gene flow between different spawning years in Pacific salmon species. Therefore, the natural occurrence of low frequencies of jack males in Chinook Salmon populations is likely beneficial for the population and species as a whole. There are both genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the tendency of a male Chinook to return as a jack, and current understanding suggests that growth rates at early life stages combined with size-at-age thresholds play key roles in the likelihood of observing the jack phenotype later in life. These factors suggest that hatchery enhancement may artificially raise the proportion of jack males in a population, and this has been observed in some hatchery lines. Despite the importance of the jack life history strategy overall, there is no doubt that larger Chinook males are more successful on the spawning grounds, and larger salmon are more valuable to fisheries. Consequently, there are concerns that hatchery enhancement may shift the distribution of ages of return towards younger age classes with negative consequences for both harvest and population-level fitness. To mitigate the risk of shifting a population’s average age of return, hatcheries may manage jacks in broodstock differently than other males by preferentially retaining older males. The jack phenotype is known to be inherited to a reasonable extent, and thus this broodstock screening should counter the likelihood of overrepresentation of jack fathers in hatchery-origin offspring. However, as genetic and environmental factors impact the tendency to jack, broodstock management would be improved and facilitated if jacks among the potential brood could be screened specifically for the genetic factors underlying the jack phenotype; these factors are the most likely to directly impact the proportion of jacks in the subsequent generation of hatchery-origin offspring. Recent research has shown that specific y-chromosome haplotypes are strongly associated with the tendency of a male to return as a jack, but these haplotypes are unique to different regions. Y-chromosome haplotypes in Canadian Chinook Salmon have not be characterized in the context of ages of return for any population, impairing the ability to develop genetic tools to refine hatchery broodstock management. Therefore, resolving the genetic variants responsible for known inheritance of the jack life history strategy is an important step in improving genetic hatchery management in the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Identify males of known age classes from previously genotyped broodstock from three Chinook populations enhanced by SEP (confirmed populations: Chilliwack River Fall, Puntledge River Fall and Qualicum River). 2) Perform reduced-representation sequencing on 256 males from each population across age classes with approximately 80 jacks per population. 3) Analyze genotype-phenotype associations between genetic variants and the age of return among individuals, including a specific analysis of y-chromosome haplotypes. The long-term objectives of the study are: 4) Expand these analyses to include additional SEP-enhanced Chinook populations from other regions to confirm the generality of genetic associations. 5) Design genetic tools to allow rapid screening of genetic variants that have large effects on the tendency of a male Chinook to return as a jack. 6) Potentially expand these analyses to examine genetic associations with age of return in female Chinook, which would also support genetic management of SEP broodstocks.\n⬅ Back to Home"

    "title": "Genetic associations with age of return in male Canadian Chinook Salmon",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Lead(s): Eric Rondeau, Tim Healy, Kyle Wellband\nDivision: Aquatic Diagnostics, Genomics and Technology (ADGT)\nSection: Molecular Genetics\nLocation: [“Chilliwack River”,“Puntledge River”,“Qualicum River”]\nStatus: Ongoing\nTheme: Innovation & Diagnostics\nPSSI Pillar: 2-Salmon enhancement\nOverview:\nChinook Salmon display arguably the widest range of life history strategies of all Pacific salmonids. One important life history strategy in male Chinooks is to return after one fewer year in the marine environment than the earliest returning females. These early-returning males or “jacks” are relatively small, and participate in spawning by employing an opportunistic “sneaker” strategy to fertilize small numbers of eggs from many spawning events involving females and larger, more dominant, males. In general, spawning success in Chinook Salmon is closely related to size; however, jacks experience the risk marine predation for at least one less year than other males, and the success of jacks is a product of negative frequency-dependent selection. In other words, as the proportion of large males increases, the relative success of jacks increases, whereas as the proportion of jacks increases, the relative success of jacks decreases. In addition, from an evolutionary perspective jack males represent an important natural avenue of gene flow between different spawning years in Pacific salmon species. Therefore, the natural occurrence of low frequencies of jack males in Chinook Salmon populations is likely beneficial for the population and species as a whole. There are both genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the tendency of a male Chinook to return as a jack, and current understanding suggests that growth rates at early life stages combined with size-at-age thresholds play key roles in the likelihood of observing the jack phenotype later in life. These factors suggest that hatchery enhancement may artificially raise the proportion of jack males in a population, and this has been observed in some hatchery lines. Despite the importance of the jack life history strategy overall, there is no doubt that larger Chinook males are more successful on the spawning grounds, and larger salmon are more valuable to fisheries. Consequently, there are concerns that hatchery enhancement may shift the distribution of ages of return towards younger age classes with negative consequences for both harvest and population-level fitness. To mitigate the risk of shifting a population’s average age of return, hatcheries may manage jacks in broodstock differently than other males by preferentially retaining older males. The jack phenotype is known to be inherited to a reasonable extent, and thus this broodstock screening should counter the likelihood of overrepresentation of jack fathers in hatchery-origin offspring. However, as genetic and environmental factors impact the tendency to jack, broodstock management would be improved and facilitated if jacks among the potential brood could be screened specifically for the genetic factors underlying the jack phenotype; these factors are the most likely to directly impact the proportion of jacks in the subsequent generation of hatchery-origin offspring. Recent research has shown that specific y-chromosome haplotypes are strongly associated with the tendency of a male to return as a jack, but these haplotypes are unique to different regions. Y-chromosome haplotypes in Canadian Chinook Salmon have not be characterized in the context of ages of return for any population, impairing the ability to develop genetic tools to refine hatchery broodstock management. Therefore, resolving the genetic variants responsible for known inheritance of the jack life history strategy is an important step in improving genetic hatchery management in the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Identify males of known age classes from previously genotyped broodstock from three Chinook populations enhanced by SEP (confirmed populations: Chilliwack River Fall, Puntledge River Fall and Qualicum River). 2) Perform reduced-representation sequencing on 256 males from each population across age classes with approximately 80 jacks per population. 3) Analyze genotype-phenotype associations between genetic variants and the age of return among individuals, including a specific analysis of y-chromosome haplotypes. The long-term objectives of the study are: 4) Expand these analyses to include additional SEP-enhanced Chinook populations from other regions to confirm the generality of genetic associations. 5) Design genetic tools to allow rapid screening of genetic variants that have large effects on the tendency of a male Chinook to return as a jack. 6) Potentially expand these analyses to examine genetic associations with age of return in female Chinook, which would also support genetic management of SEP broodstocks.\n⬅ Back to Home"

This knowledge is required to identify effective mediation strategies under anthropogenic control. An innovative salmon Fit-Chip tool is poised to fill this knowledge gap. The salmon Fit-Chip tool contains curated biomarker panels that can specifically recognize independent stressors (thermal, osmotic, hypoxia), disease states (viral), imminent mortality (natural death within 72 hours), and smolt readiness (differentiating pre- smolts, smolts and de-smolts), based on profiling from non-lethal gill biopsy samples. Fit-chips also contain biomarkers associated with inflammation and immune activation, and can include assays to key pathogens and parasites.\nWhile physical oceanographic monitoring can provide environmental measures of temperature, oxygen, and salinity, they do not tell us whether fish are actually experiencing stress, or possibly avoiding areas where these stressors occur. Fit-Chip data allow us to directly test whether the highest ranking environmental risk factors identified in the WCVI Marine Risk Assessments—elevated temperature summer through early fall and reduced oxygen in the fall, the moderate risk of carryover effects (in this case smolt readiness rather than size) and exposure to HABs, cause physiological stress and impairment in Chinook salmon. Moreover, Fit-Chips can effectively identify habitats where salmon are least vs most compromised, allowing regulators and habitat biologists to target remediation where needed most, with remediation success tracked via decreased stress.\nWorking within the West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) \"Follow the fish Research Consortium funded under PSSI, under objective 1, we will run Fit- Chips on 2,000 Chinook released from Robertson and Nitinat hatcheries sampled over the migration trajectory from freshwater-estuary-marine, including overwintering Chinook caught across all 5 WCVI sounds through microtrolling led by local First Nations. Using a south coast wide Fit-Chip dataset developed in 2022-2023 using PSSI funding, comprised of over 4500 Chinook sampled from 2008-2018, we will employ stock-recruitment models to identify associations between individual stressors and population-level survival across the southern BC coast, and build a new model framework to address the cumulative interplay between stress and disease undermining survival. This analysis will address several of the risk factors identified in the WCVI Marine Risk Assessment for Chinook salmon, including climate-driven environmental stressors (temperature, hypoxia, salinity) and pathogens/disease, and their association with survival. We will then apply this knowledge to our Fit-Chip data on WCVI Chinook collected from 2022-2024, along with the physical oceanographic data collected at the same time, to identify where and when environmental stressors are “felt” by WCVI Chinook, including their relationship with measured environmental parameters, and where and when signs of increased morbidity occur. Importantly, this spatial analysis will also address the anthropogenically controlled intrinsic and extrinsic factors associated with stressors and diseases that pose the highest population-level risk to WCVI Chinook. The ultimate goal is to identify stressor and/or disease impacts that can be effectively mediated to increase early marine survival of salmon, and habitats where mediation is most urgently required.\nThe WCVI Marine Risk Assessments identified prey availability/feeding a high current and future risk, pathogens/parasites a moderate current and high future risk, and predation/HABs a moderate risks. Data gaps were identified for all of these risk factors. While multiple individual projects are proposed to tackle most of these risk factors and where they are most strongly felt in Barclay and Clayoquot Sound, eDNA offers a more holistic tool to identify the species compositions – e.g. salmon spp, predators, prey, competitors, infective agents, HABs, that can corroborate community assessment more efficiently over a broader spatial scale. Under objective 2, we will carry out eDNA sampling in the same areas and seasons where the follow the fish project is actively catching fish, starting in the estuaries and Barclay Sound in spring/summer, and moving into Clayoquot sound in the early fall and throughout all five sounds overwinter. In addition to providing an ecosystem characterization via metabarcoding, and pathogens through our infective agent monitoring system – including potential hot-spot areas around farms/processing plants, eDNA may also provide more information on areas of the sound where salmon are more or less abundant. Importantly, under this objective we will integrate data analyses with projects using a more traditional species assessments (e.g. via plankton sampling, HAB monitoring, hydroacoustics). Importantly, when contrasting eDNA community compositions in ecosystems where salmon show indices of optimal vs compromised health, we can provide a second pillar to develop and measure the effectiveness of mediation efforts.\n⬅ Back to Home"

    "text": "Lead(s): Daniel Doutaz\nDivision: Stock Assessment and Research (StAR)\nSection: Fraser and Interior Area Salmon Stock Assessment\nLocation: [“Cultus”]\nStatus: Ongoing\nTheme: Threat Assessment and Mitigation\nPSSI Pillar: 1-Conservation and stewardship\nOverview:\nSmallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), a piscivorous fish species native to eastern North America, have been introduced into Cultus Lake, British Columbia. Cultus Lake is home to endangered sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) as well as endemic Cultus pygmy sculpin (Cottus aleuticus). Smallmouth bass introduced in other salmon-bearing habitat have been observed to exert substantial mortality on salmon fry and smolts, suggesting a similar impact may be possible in Cultus Lake. Observations of sockeye salmon, and Cultus pygmy sculpin in the diet of captured smallmouth bass demonstrates predation upon two native species at risk. While smallmouth bass represent a threat to the Cultus Lake native fish community and species at risk specifically, they are also highly valued by some anglers. Importantly, as a source population, they also represent a real and present threat to other ecosystems in the Lower Mainland. Smallmouth bass are often found in streams and rivers; in fact, they have already been found downstream of Cultus Lake. Additionally, there is the threat of anglers moving smallmouth bass to other waterbodies in the Lower Mainland to create new bass fisheries, which themselves would create risk to receiving environments. While there are largemouth bass (M. salmoides) populations in various waterbodies throughout the Lower Mainland, this is the first verified smallmouth bass population, and has drawn a lot of attention from the angling community. Early work on this population has identified a divergence of public opinions: some value native species (especially sockeye salmon) and want to see bass suppressed; other values angling opportunities for smallmouth bass and will strongly oppose any measures to affect this valued fishery resource.\nThere are two issues that this project will address: (1) understanding which suppression options will result in the lowest opposition from anglers and community members, thereby identifying the risk of unintended consequences (e.g., additional transfers to other lakes); and (2) determining the suppression strategy (combination of different suppression options) which will best inform estimates of effectiveness for each suppression option so as to maximize effective suppression moving forward to reduce impacts on sockeye salmon recruitment.\nIn year one of this project, an electrofishing boat will be used to capture smallmouth bass, and all bass will be tagged with passive integrated transponders (PIT tags). These PIT-tagged fish will help determine the initial population size (through mark-recapture methods) and provide a baseline for future smallmouth bass suppression efforts. A subset of smallmouth bass will also be tagged using acoustic transmitters (n=25; Vemco V9 & V13 acoustic tags) to track their movements within the Cultus Lake system, and to determine if any emigration out of the system is occurring.\nThe smallmouth bass fishery will be monitored to assess total fishing effort (using standard access point creel survey procedures), harvest rates, harvest size, and catch rates (total number fish released + harvested). All harvested bass reported by anglers will be measured, weighted, scanned for PIT tags, and have scales removed for later aging. Additionally, as part of the catch monitoring program anglers will be surveyed to determine their level of satisfaction with their bass catch rates and size, native fish catch rates and their opinions on the different suppression options considered. These survey answers will allow for changes in utility and attitudes to be tracked over time.\nLastly, nest destruction and removal of male bass guarding nests is to occur once spawning begins in the spring. Bass activity in the spring should be monitored frequently to identify the start of spawning season. Once nests are constructed, a survey of known spawning locations should occur to identify nests for destruction. Captured males will be measured, weighed, have sex and maturity status confirmed, scanned for PIT tags, and have scales and/or otoliths removed for aging.\nThis project was developed in partnership between Simon Fraser University, the Province of BC, and the DFO.

In general, Pacific salmon return to their natal spawning grounds to reproduce, and not surprisingly this has resulted in substantial genetic variation among different salmon populations throughout the Canadian range. Genetic variants among and within populations of the majority of Canadian Pacific salmon have been characterized using relatively low numbers of genetic markers, and this characterization has enabled the development of the genetic-stock identification and parentage-based tagging programs within Fisheries and Oceans Canada which provide vital information for management of fisheries and hatcheries. Despite the utility of these developments, low- density genetic markers are insufficient to assess adaptive genetic variation in these species, leaving critical gaps for conserving fitness-associated genetic diversity and for improving resilience to climate change. Previously, the costs of next-generation sequencing were prohibitive for assessing genome- wide genetic variation in species with large genomes such as salmonids. However, reductions in these costs combined with publication of reference genome sequences for the Pacific salmonids has opened novel opportunities to address these gaps. The proposed project will utilize low-coverage whole- genome resequencing to assess genome-wide patterns of genetic variation among and within populations of Pacific salmon. These data will feed into several analyses to identify genomic regions and variation involved in environmental adaptation, to reassess the genetic support for currently defined conservation unit boundaries, and to estimate the relative climate change resilience of different populations of Canadian Pacific salmon. Initially, the proposed project will focus on Chinook and Sockeye Salmon with a goal of sequencing individuals from 48 populations of each species distributed across the species’ range. We will leverage samples currently available in the Molecular Genetics DNA archives to enable these efforts. In the longer-term, the objectives of this project will expand these sequencing efforts to increase the coverage of individuals, populations and species of Pacific salmon. This expansion of scope will be necessary to fully consider conservation of within population genetic diversity, and to resolve parallel patterns of genetic adaptation across Pacific salmon in Canada. The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Identify 48 populations representative of the range-wide diversity of Chinook and Sockeye Salmon. 2) Obtain samples from 18 Chinook individuals or 8 Sockeye individuals from each identified population from the Molecular Genetics DNA archives, and extract DNA for each sample. 3) Prepare the extracted DNA samples for low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, and submit the samples to an external sequencing service provider. 4) Collect relevant environmental datasets and climate change projections for the locations and life histories of the identified populations. 5) Receive sequencing reads for all submitted DNA samples. The long-term objectives of the study are: 6) Align sequencing reads from the first year of the study to the Chinook or Sockeye Salmon reference genomes. 7) Determine allele frequency variation among and within populations of each species. 8) Analyze genome-wide population structure in each species and identify outlier regions of genetic differentiation among populations. 9) Analyze genome-environment associations to resolve environmental factors underlying genetic differentiation among populations. 10) Utilize current inter-population genomic variation to determine “genomic offsets” in the context of climate change projections (i.e., the extent of genetic change necessary to parallel expected changes in the environment). 11) Expand sampling and sequencing effort to include Chum, Pink and Coho Salmon, and to add additional Chinook and Sockeye Salmon population that address any gaps in the initial analysis. 12) Repeat the analyses above across species to evaluate cross-species patterns and factors important to Pacific salmon adaptation in Canada. 13) Report on genome-wide genetic variation in comparison to existing conservation unit boundaries with dedicated consideration of putatively adaptive genetic variation. 14) Report on genetic estimates of relative climate change resilience among different populations of each Pacific salmon species examined.\n⬅ Back to Home"

The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Identify 48 populations representative of the range-wide diversity of Chinook and Sockeye Salmon. 2) Obtain samples from 18 Chinook individuals or 8 Sockeye individuals from each identified population from the Molecular Genetics DNA archives, and extract DNA for each sample. 3) Prepare the extracted DNA samples for low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, and submit the samples to an external sequencing service provider. 4) Collect relevant environmental datasets and climate change projections for the locations and life histories of the identified populations. 5) Receive sequencing reads for all submitted DNA samples. The long-term objectives of the study are: 6) Align sequencing reads from the first year of the study to the Chinook or Sockeye Salmon reference genomes. 7) Determine allele frequency variation among and within populations of each species. 8) Analyze genome-wide population structure in each species and identify outlier regions of genetic differentiation among populations. 9) Analyze genome-environment associations to resolve environmental factors underlying genetic differentiation among populations. 10) Utilize current inter-population genomic variation to determine “genomic offsets” in the context of climate change projections (i.e., the extent of genetic change necessary to parallel expected changes in the environment). 11) Expand sampling and sequencing effort to include Chum, Pink and Coho Salmon, and to add additional Chinook and Sockeye Salmon population that address any gaps in the initial analysis. 12) Repeat the analyses above across species to evaluate cross-species patterns and factors important to Pacific salmon adaptation in Canada. 13) Report on genome-wide genetic variation in comparison to existing conservation unit boundaries with dedicated consideration of putatively adaptive genetic variation. 14) Report on genetic estimates of relative climate change resilience among different populations of each Pacific salmon species examined.\n⬅ Back to Home"

We would continue this monitoring, and add two additional moorings in the Strait of Georgia / Haro Strait to obtain high temporal and vertical resolution data on key ecosystem components (zooplankton and krill, juvenile salmon, forage species, and adult salmon – in particular Chinook due to their large size). The new mooring positions would be strategically selected to build on ongoing sampling programs in the Salish Sea. 2) Build on existing acoustic-trawl surveys in the Strait of Georgia (focused on Pacific Hake and walleye pollock assessments) to develop spatially-explicit estimates of krill biomass for the Strait and main inlets, along with information on density and distribution of forage fish species (e.g. Pacific herring). Other surveys within the Salish Sea also collect acoustic data that would feed into these estimates, such as the Spring and Fall juvenile salmon surveys (Neville). 3) Incorporate portable echosounder systems to complement current zooplankton and oceanographic sampling efforts (Sastri). 4) Carry out dedicated small-scale acoustic surveys in targeted areas to assess poorly monitored forage fish species that are important for salmon, with particular attention to Pacific Sandlance.\n⬅ Back to Home"

The annual Chilko Lake Sockeye smolt assessment (1951-present) comprises the only long-term time series data available to assess juvenile recruitment, and freshwater and marine productivity for wild Fraser River Sockeye salmon. Since program inception, Sockeye smolts have been enumerated during their out-migration from Chilko Lake using a traditional fish counting weir and photographic sampling/counting techniques. During the first six decades of the program (1951-2012), interruptions in weir operation were relatively rare: in only three years (1979, 1993, 2006) did early freshets necessitate removal of the weir before the vast majority of smolts had migrated from Chilko Lake.\nRecently, unusually early freshets have been experienced in the Chilko watershed that have translated into high and variable water conditions much earlier in the season. As such, DFO Stock Assessment crews were not able to operate the weir in 2015 due to high water flows, and have had to remove the weir structure prior to the completion of smolt migration on numerous other recent years (e.g., 2019). The observed increase in the frequency of early freshets in the Chilko watershed is consistent with predicted hydrographic changes for interior BC streams as a whole in response to climate variability, with the average timing of the spring freshet expected to continue shifting earlier as air temperatures rise. The future of operating the Chilko Sockeye smolt weir is in jeopardy given the current trend related to the timing, frequency, and strength of the spring freshets. If proven effective, the SONAR method would provide an alternate assessment method for the Chilko watershed that could be quickly employed in years when high flows either prevent the installation of the weir at the beginning of the migration, or necessitate the removal of the weir before the smolt migration is largely complete.\nThe objective of this work is to test the feasibility of using upward-looking SONAR technology to assess daily abundances of Chilko Lake sockeye smolts as they migrate downstream through the Chilko River. This technology has proven to be effective for enumerating migrating smolts in comparable rivers in Alaska. The reliably of the method will be evaluated based on how well the daily SONAR-derived abundance indices predict the daily migration totals observed at the counting weir that is deployed annually on the Chilko River. A pilot study employing this technology was initiated within the Chilko watershed in the spring of 2021, and following two consecutive years of data collection the results appear to be promising; however, in both 2021 and 2022, water levels have been below seasonal averages and we have yet to experience a high-water event with the SONARs in place. Additional years of this project are therefore required before any conclusions can be made regarding the effectiveness of this technology as a substitute for the currently employed counting weir on the Chilko River.\n⬅ Back to Home"

Recovery efforts have determined that the marine survival of this population is very low, which is a major limiting factor to population recovery. On water surveys of pinnipeds from the estuary out to the seal haul outs on Hodgson Islands (approximately 2km from the estuary, Figure 1) during the spring out-migration timing (since 2019) have estimated from approximately 100-350 harbour seals in the area.\nThis project was started as a pilot in 2022 to test the hypothesis that the Hodgson Island harbour seal population is negatively affecting smolt survival, and subsequently adult returns. The goal of the project is to transport and release smolts past the seal haul out and then compare marine survival rates between transported smolts and those out-migrating naturally. The pilot project began with a low number of smolts transported in small trial releases to test the effect of additional handling/ osmoregulation on fish as well as the function of equipment. Small numbers of fish were PIT tagged to confirm fish are able to recover from the procedure and be transported on the same day. Additional activities included continuation of harbour seal counts (Figure 2) on local haul outs during the smolt (May) and adult (July) peak migration windows. Transport activities are conducted with shíshálh Nation’s newly acquired 30 foot aluminum landing craft which is suited to this kind of work.\nIn years 2-5 (spring 2023-2026), we propose scaling up releases to achieve adequate sample sizes in order to properly test the hypothesis. A minimum of 1,000 and up to 2,500 PIT tagged sockeye are recommended per year such that a 1% survival will yield a total of 10-25 tag returns. Return rates of less than 1% may be too low to justify operationalizing this activity long term. The transport of non-tagged fish should be avoided as to not confound comparisons with the control group (untagged fence migrants). Results from 2023/24 releases will be realized in 2025/26 escapement years at which point a decision on the future of the project can be made. Additional activities may include walking the Hodson Island haul out with a mobile PIT tag antenna to look for evidence of predation on out migrating smolts (river or transport groups; Coho and Sockeye), or installing a PIT antenna on the haul out.\nSakinaw Sockeye has been confirmed as an endangered stock since 2003, and a recovery potential assessment, completed in 2017 cited low marine survival as the greatest limiting factor in recovery, with predator abundance and assumed predation on smolts and adults ranked as high risk, with a critical level of impact. Perpetually low marine survivals are preventing recovery such that the persistence of the population is entirely dependent on a captive brood program. This activity may be one of the few tools available to increase survival.\n⬅ Back to Home"

Yet, it remains challenging to make explicit predictions about how hydrology influences salmon. We aim to advance a mechanistic and tractable modelling framework that links hydrology (flow and temperature) to local-scale habitat availability and productivity potential of stream-rearing juvenile salmon. The proposed approach integrates well-established theory of geomorphology and fish energetics to predict how juvenile salmon rearing habitat availability and productivity potential is influenced by dynamic flow and temperature regimes (Fig. 1). The approach aims to be accessible by using a tractable set of inputs that would emerge from typical field habitat monitoring and is applicable across different systems and salmonid species. We propose rolling out this modelling framework as part of a larger watershed- scale research program in the North Thompson, where we have established an extensive field monitoring network of flow, temperature, and habitat conditions that would be direct model inputs. Ongoing intensive monitoring of juvenile coho populations and physiological condition (D. Patterson proposal) in these systems will inform model validation. For example, modelled predictions could be directly compared to measures of coho abundance, production, or physiological condition.\nWe anticipate 3 main outcomes from the work: (1) a modelling framework and interface (e.g., R Shiny App); (2) predictions of how juvenile coho rearing habitat availability and productivity potential responds to diverse flow and temperature regimes across tributaries of the North Thompson; and (3) advice to internal and external clients for setting environmental flow guidelines under dynamic hydrologic conditions. For example, the work will directly plug into ongoing engagement with the Thompson-Shuswap Environmental Flows Committee, which is actively developing flow management guidelines and drought response thresholds for the region. Further, the modelling framework will provide a platform to explore the potential consequences of climate and land use impacts on flows and temperatures, e.g., based on broader-scale, climate averaged temperature and flow projections under climate change (J. Iacarella proposal). This would provide a powerful, yet computationally simple and accessible way to explore and communicate the dynamic relationships between flows and salmon in a warming world. Overall, the approach is easily extendable to other systems and salmonid species, thus could become a widely used tool across the Province.\nApproaches to predict biological responses to flow are integral to numerous management issues. We envision the modelling framework informing regulatory decision-making by FFHPP related to flow alterations (e.g., hydro operations or water withdrawals), as well as land use and restoration planning. Our work fills a gap for these applications given that existing instream flow modelling tends to either be static and descriptive and thus not applicable to dynamic conditions, or have prohibitively steep information and computational requirements. This is a 3-year project that would support two parallel elements: (1) collection of habitat, flow, and temperature data in coho rearing tributaries across the North Thompson; and (2) development of model structure and interface.

However, there are a multitude of non-fishing threats facing BC salmon that have not been fully identified nor characterized including Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS), harmful algal blooms (HABs), disease and pathogens, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals, etc. Further, many of these stressors can interact such that the cumulative effect of these stressors is likely greater than the sum of individual stressors. However, these stressors are unlikely evenly distributed across the Pacific such that different stocks will face different stressors and may respond differently. Thus, spatial and stock considerations will be critical. Finally, these stressors are affecting BC salmon at different life history stages across the freshwater, estuarine, and marine systems they utilize to complete their life cycle with climate change exacerbating the problem. By developing a decision support framework it will be possible to identify and characterize the individual and multiple stressors affecting salmon productivity or recovery in a standardized way among Pacific salmon stocks. This will allow managers to better incorporate and mitigate these non-fishing stressors most impacting salmon in decision making. Not only will this conveying a more complete understanding of stock status and threats to industry, stakeholders, and First Nations it will facilitate the inclusion of this information in fisheries management plans and SARA recovery plans. Further, this approach will allow targeting limited resources to those stressors that can best be managed with a clearer understanding of how salmon may be expected to respond when these threats are mitigated.\nBased on the non-fishing threats identified in the previous year, along with their expected impacts on BC salmon stocks, we will develop a geospatial dataset of these threats that can then be attributed to individual stocks. By developing an interaction matrix it will be possible to specify the stock- specific threats facing BC salmon and clearly indicate which management decision making processes need to include this information (e.g., fishing plan, recovery plan).\nAt the Nov 2022 workshop our breakout group identified a number of known stressors and in some cases we were able to identify specific threats to salmon. However, we had a much longer list of potential stressors for which we did not have subject matter experts. Thus, the first step will be to hire a dedicated BI-02 who will undertake a literature review, including Fisheries Management Plans, CSAS Advisory Documents, SARA Recovery Potential Assessments and Recovery Plans, to identify a range of non-fishing stressors affecting salmon and how DFO currently considers/doesn’t consider them in decision making. The second step will be to talk to subject matter experts both withing and outside DFO to fill information gaps that are identified during the initial review. This preliminary list will then be used in the third step, targeted workshops, where the experts will work to identify the causal mechanisms behind these stressors (e.g., life history stage affected, type of impact, duration, intensity, magnitude, recovery, etc.) and how they can be better considered in DFO decision making. This dual approach of literature review and expert opinions has been used previously to identify stressors impacting kelp recovery in the Salish Sea (Hollarsmith et al. 2022).\nBased on the results of the first two years of the project, the third year will specifically develop decision support tools that will aid managers in how best to incorporate non-fishing threats across an array of DFO management and policy decision making processes, including, but not limited to Fisheries Management, SARA recovery planning, SEP restoration activities, and FFHPP integrated planning processes.

Modelling work started in fiscal year 2021-22 and main deliverables (a coupled physical-biogeochemical model of WCVI, south of Kyuquot) are expected by the end of 2023-24. A small observational component started during 2021-22 and has grown in scope every year. Through PSSI, we have two main goals: to create a monitoring program for Clayoquot Sound in 2023-24 (that will ideally extend to 2025-26) and to support and extend modelling efforts in the WCVI.\nSpecifically, we propose the following: a. Establish a Clayoquot Sound Monitoring Program in collaboration with the local First Nations (FN) and other organizations (Hakai Institute and Nature Trust of BC). Talks with all involved parties started in 2022-23; the plan is to provide training and equipment to the FN so they can use their vessels to perform monthly conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sampling throughout Clayoquot Sound (45 stations). These observations will support ongoing modelling work and will provide an important baseline of environmental conditions (including oxygen) throughout the year. This baseline is needed to understand the present-day environment experienced by migrating Pacific salmon. Without this baseline, it will be difficult to assess the effects of climate change in salmon populations and migrating routes.\n\nHire a term PC3 to contribute to the progress of the coupled physical- biogeochemical model for the west coast of Vancouver Island. In particular, this PC3 will lead the simulation of future scenarios and will act as a liaison with salmon experts, to ensure that the outputs of our simulations are useful for population distribution modelling and other salmon-related projections.\nHire a term EG4 to contribute towards DFO-led fieldwork in the WCVI inlets as well as data processing and management. For instance, technical support is needed for the development/improvement of weather stations and the maintenance of the weather station network (their data are crucial for forcing the surface of coastal ocean models), as well as for support with mooring deployment/servicing and opportunistic CTD sampling (e.g., while servicing weather stations). Furthermore, the EG4 will be needed to manage the inflow of data from the Clayoquot Sound Monitoring Program.\n\nManagement questions: Near-surface hypoxia (as shallow as 12 m) has been recently identified in Herbert Inlet, Clayoquot Sound (Rosen et al., 2022, doi:10.3389/fmars.2022.1000041). The historical record in the region is sparse, but it suggests that shallow hypoxia is found occasionally in this inlet. Are salmon runs affected by low-oxygen conditions near the surface in the fjords? Do these shallow hypoxic events constrain/restrict salmon habitat during their migration? Are these shallow hypoxic events increasing in frequency or can they be predicted in any way? (e.g., more common during marine heat waves or during positive/negative ENSO years, etc.). In order to address these questions, as well as the more generic question “What is the environment that salmon encounter during their migration into and out of the rivers, i.e. while they swim through fjords?”, we need to establish a monitoring program throughout the fjords of interest. A consistent sampling program in the next few years will create the baseline from which we will be able to assess future changes; and a monitoring program that continues in the future will make sure we can identify any climate-related change in the fjords’ environment. Furthermore, by combining observations and high- resolution (tens of meters) ocean models, we will be able to understand the mechanisms that drive oxygen (and other – e.g., acidification) conditions in the inlets, and predict how these will be impacted by a changing climate. The modelling work proposed here for the WCVI will allow for the first study of the impacts of future conditions in these fjords.\n⬅ Back to Home"

Furthermore, the EG4 will be needed to manage the inflow of data from the Clayoquot Sound Monitoring Program.\n\nManagement questions: Near-surface hypoxia (as shallow as 12 m) has been recently identified in Herbert Inlet, Clayoquot Sound (Rosen et al., 2022, doi:10.3389/fmars.2022.1000041). The historical record in the region is sparse, but it suggests that shallow hypoxia is found occasionally in this inlet. Are salmon runs affected by low-oxygen conditions near the surface in the fjords? Do these shallow hypoxic events constrain/restrict salmon habitat during their migration? Are these shallow hypoxic events increasing in frequency or can they be predicted in any way? (e.g., more common during marine heat waves or during positive/negative ENSO years, etc.). In order to address these questions, as well as the more generic question “What is the environment that salmon encounter during their migration into and out of the rivers, i.e. while they swim through fjords?”, we need to establish a monitoring program throughout the fjords of interest. A consistent sampling program in the next few years will create the baseline from which we will be able to assess future changes; and a monitoring program that continues in the future will make sure we can identify any climate-related change in the fjords’ environment. Furthermore, by combining observations and high- resolution (tens of meters) ocean models, we will be able to understand the mechanisms that drive oxygen (and other – e.g., acidification) conditions in the inlets, and predict how these will be impacted by a changing climate. The modelling work proposed here for the WCVI will allow for the first study of the impacts of future conditions in these fjords.\n⬅ Back to Home"

These declines have put immense strain on the subsistence communities and Fish Nations that historically depended upon Chinook salmon throughout the Yukon River. They have also impacted the ability of the United States and Canada to meet escapement goals under the Pacific Salmon Treaty’s Yukon River Agreement, and are likely to have resulted in the Stock Management Unit, which is scheduled to be prescribed by regulation under the amended Fisheries Act in 2023/2024, to fall below its Limit Reference Point. In recent years large numbers (33%-52%) of returning Canadian-origin Chinook salmon have gone “missing” between sonar assessments at the mouth of the Yukon River and ~2000 km upriver at the border between Alaska and Canada. This has severely undermined the efficacy of fisheries management measures within the Alaskan portion of the river. A leading hypothesis for these missing fish is en route mortality due to heat stress (JTC 2020), which has been documented along with opportunistic observation of premature mortalities in Yukon River Chinook Salmon when spawning migration water temperatures exceed 18°C (Biela et al. 2020; 2022). However, direct estimates of en route mortality do not exist and a recent CSAS regional peer review (DFO 2022) identified the drivers and magnitude of en route mortality, and their consequences for management advice, as a critical uncertainty.\nWe propose to carry out a 3 year radio-telemetry project to quantify en route mortality of Yukon Chinook in relation to freshwater environmental conditions along their up to ~3000km migration from the mouth of the Yukon river to headwater spawning grounds. We will then use these estimates of en route mortality to evaluate the sustainability of the current aggregate escapement goal for Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook, and rebuilding potential of component Conservation Units (Connors et al. 2022) to inform analyses to meet the Fish Stock Provisions of the revised Fisheries Act for the Stock Management Unit. We are specifically seeking funding to extend radio-tracking infrastructure (towers and aerial overflights) into Canada to take advantage of an Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) project that will tag and track ~600 Chinook salmon in the Alaskan Portion of the Yukon River.\nThe management question being addressed by this project is: what is the magnitude of en route mortality in Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook and what are its consequences for international and domestic fisheries management, rebuilding potential, and integrated planning.\nThe specific outcomes of this project include:\n\nestimates of migration speed, timing, and en route mortality of Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook, by Conservation Unit and river section, in relation to freshwater environmental conditions; and\nquantitative evaluation of the consequences of a range of en route mortality (based on study) for the sustainability of alternative aggregate escapement goals and rebuilding potential.\n\n⬅ Back to Home"

West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschwatcha) populations declined precipitously after the 1990s. Survival rates for naturally spawning WCVI Chinook are now below replacement levels. In 2020, WCVI Chinook was listed as “Threatened” by Canada’s Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife triggering the Chinook Rebuilding Plan and the marine and freshwater risk assessment (FWRA) processes. Results from the FWRA, highlighted that across the region the incubation life history phase was extremely data deficient. High incubation mortality can reduce productivity and limit the recovery of Chinook salmon populations. A small change in survival during this life history phase can have significant implications on production. Redd scour was identified as a high priority data gap in the indicator watersheds throughout WCVI. The purpose of this study is to evaluate redd scour, sediment transport, and hydrological conditions in three indicator watersheds in Area 23 and Area 24. This study will be important for developing a standard methodology to address this data gap, and for characterizing the scale of the issue. The results will be vital for developing indicators and benchmarks, and to inform restoration, enhancement, and rebuilding measures for WCVI Chinook.\n\nThe outcomes of the redd scour study are to: A. Develop a robust methodology to measure redd scour that can be repeated in indicator watersheds across the region; B. Estimate what percentage of redds are scoured at different flow thresholds and how that impacts salmonid mortality during incubation; and, C. Understand what effect more frequent and higher peak flows in a changing climate will have on redd scour and salmonid mortality in the future.\n\nThe methodology for the study has three components: I. The installation of a hydrometric station that is calibrated to provide a continuous discharge record for Tranquil Creek and implement a pilot methodology in Tranquil Creek (completed 2022). II. Field surveys in spawning locations that includes cross- sections and sediment size measurements, and the installation of PIT tagged accelerometer scour chains at surveyed locations to measure redd scour; (planned for Sarita [externally funded] and Tranquil in 2023 and Bedwell 2024). III. Pairing bed disturbance data with a 2D hydraulic model to estimate the spatial extent of bed disturbance at a reach scale in key Chinook and chum spawning areas. (Planned for 2023 in Sarita [externally funded] and 2024 Bedwell).\n\nThe results from this study will be important for characterizing the scale of the issue and will be vital for developing restoration prescriptions and can inform indicator development, enhancement, and rebuilding strategies in the region. In particular, for the Bedwell and Sarita Rivers, a rotary screw trap provides a total abundance estimate, which facilities that calculation of the egg-fry survival rate. Developing a relationship between over-winter egg-fry survival and redd scour and sediment movement, will be important for understanding the scale of the issue in watersheds across WVCI and the urgency needed to address this issue.\n\n⬅ Back to Home"

Bringing Indigenous knowledge systems and Western science together will lead to more equitable and inclusive outcomes, supporting the aims of reconciliation and furthering the capacity for Indigenous self governance. Achieving sustainability of salmon fisheries cannot be achieved through a Western scientific lens alone; incorporating Indigenous Knowledge Systems and a broader perspective on what is considered healthy and serious harm in salmon ecosystems will be essential.

It was adapted from existing DFO risk assessment frameworks and a risk assessment framework for fisheries in Australia, and provides a standardized and semi-quantitative method to integrate ecosystem data and expert opinion related to salmon survival across all their life stages. The resulting list of ranked risks identifies both high priority management needs and data gaps that require additional investigation.\nRAMS has been applied in more than a half dozen watersheds for Chinook (ocean and stream type), coho, and sockeye to inform Recovery Potential Assessments under the Species at Risk Act and Rebuilding Plans under the Fish Stock Provisions of the Fisheries Act. RAMS continues to evolve toward a standard methodology flexible enough to assess risks at different scales and with various levels of data availability. Included in those methods are: Regional Salmon Information Tables that provide scientific information about freshwater limiting factors for all major life history strategies of Pacific salmon species; a deterministic Life History Model template completed using relevant population data; an Ecosystem (Habitat) Status Report template completed using existing habitat and ecosystem information; and a Risk Assessment Matrix template completed during a RAMS workshop, currently in Excel format.\nAreas of improvement for RAMS have been identified to facilitate regional implementation. Several components will be addressed by the existing project team, but some are beyond the capacity and/or expertise of the team and are the purpose of this proposed work. These include: (A) updates to the Regional Salmon Information Tables. This resource has not been updated since inception and significant new science is available to maintain relevance. Inclusion of marine information is also necessary to understand the bottlenecks to salmon across all their life stages. And (B) a conversion from the Excel-based Risk Assessment Matrix template to an R program based on a relational database with an interactive user interface. The Excel-based template is functional but does not allow for visualization of the many ecosystem components that are aggregated to understand risk; complex analysis of relationships between indicators and limiting factors; or hierarchical meta-analyses of data gaps and risk across stocks to facilitate prioritization of monitoring and research. Conversion to a relational database with a user interface will allow for this functionality.\n(2) OUTCOMES:\nA updated, robust RAMS framework applicable for all salmon species structured for continuous learning and updating, that is user-friendly for DFO and non- DFO technical staff. Specifically, 1. Updated Regional Salmon Information Tables by life stage and ecosystem unit, including indicators, benchmarks, and guidance for RAMS facilitators. Request is for two BI-02s to update through existing literature and engage with DFO and other scientists (e.g., Dr. Jonathon Moore’s lab at SFU, Institute of Ocean Sciences oceanographers) to facilitate addition of freshwater and marine indicators and information. The team will pilot the tables for use in rebuilding and recovery processes and update as needed. 2. Updated Risk Assessment Matrix template from Excel to an R-based program and backend database. This will require specialized coding expertise either through hiring or contract.\n3. Workshop(s) with relevant DFO staff will be used to scope the structure and functionality required. 4. Updates to the RAMS methodology and support work will require 0.35 FTE (Full Time Equivalents) for a BI-03.\n(3) THE MANAGEMENT QUESTION(S) ADDRESSED\nRAMS will prioritize risks to salmon stocks across the 3 Hs of Habitat, Harvest, and Hatcheries by identifying management and mitigation options most likely to result in successful restoration and rebuilding, which will support decision making in each of the 3Hs. It will prioritize scientific research and monitoring to address key knowledge gaps and integrate knowledge across disciplines inside and outside DFO.

    "title": "San Juan River Adult and Juvenile Assessment Program",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Lead(s): Katie Davidson\nDivision: Stock Assessment and Research (StAR)\nSection: South Coast Area Salmon Stock Assessment\nLocation: [“San Juan River”,“Port San Juan”,“4 Mile Creek”]\nStatus: Ongoing\nTheme: Salmon Monitoring\nPSSI Pillar: 1-Conservation and stewardship\nOverview:\nThe San Juan River is major watershed on southwest Vancouver Island (near Port Renfrew, BC) that supports distinct populations of Chinook, Coho and Chum, with Chinook enhanced annually at the 4 Mile Hatchery. Although logging throughout the watershed has resulted in considerable gravel deposition and bank erosion along the spawning reaches of the river, there is still an extensive intact estuary connecting the San Juan and Gordon Rivers that provides valuable rearing habitat for juvenile salmon. The San Juan River empties into Port San Juan (PFMA 20-2).\nPacheedaht First Nation’s Salmon Stewardship Program conducts monitoring and restoration work in and around the San Juan-Gordon watersheds to mitigate logging effects and rebuild salmon stocks. Their monitoring work spans the salmon lifecycle and includes investigating impacts of redd scour on egg-to- fry survival, documenting juvenile salmon habitat use in the estuary, and conducting adult spawner surveys. Recently, they have also launched a pilot Chinook mass-marking program with the 4 Mile Hatchery to reduce the impacts of hatchery genetics on the wild Chinook population through selective removals of adipose-clipped Chinook in terminal fisheries (community/FSC, and potentially sport).\nThese activities all inform the San Juan Chinook Rebuilding Plan currently in development by Pacheedaht, which will feed into the broader WCVI Chinook Rebuilding Plan in development by DFO (required under the Fish Stock Provisions Act for naturally-produced WCVI Chinook, due March 2024) (DFO 2022; Minister of Justice 2022). However, the recent WCVI Chinook Risk Assessment process identified several knowledge gaps, mostly related to early freshwater and marine life cycle stages. For San Juan Chinook specifically, juvenile data from these life stages (and interactions between hatchery and wild juveniles) are sparse, and spawner abundance data are limited in scope not only for Chinook, but also Coho and Chum.\nThese reasons make the San Juan River a good candidate to develop an integrated life history monitoring program in alignment with the larger Follow The Fish program. We propose to continue work initiated in 2022-2023 that collected data across four life stages of San Juan Chinook, thus complementing Pacheedaht’s established programs. First, we will implement a rotary screw trap to intercept naturally-produced out-migrating juveniles (all species, but focused on spring juvenile Chinook migration timing), allowing us to compare natural migration timing to hatchery release timing and to gather baseline biological traits relative to hatchery releases (e.g., size, condition). If funding and resources permit, a feasibility mark-recapture to obtain a relative abundance estimate for naturally-produced juvenile Chinook will be implemented. Second, we will conduct biweekly purse seining in Port San Juan during summer months (~May-August) to collect mixed-stock information, including hatchery/natural-origin of juvenile Chinook, stock ID, biological traits, environmental stress responses (through gill clips), relative abundance, and information on other species schooling with Chinook (e.g., Coho, Pacific Herring). Third, we will continue winter microtrolling work in Port San Juan that began in 2021 as part of the Follow The Fish project, which will collect detailed biological information (similar to purse seining data) on overwintering juvenile Chinook and Coho. We will also calibrate microtrolling and purse seining methods through simultaneous sampling events. Fourth, we will deploy a Garmin LiveScope hydroacoustic fish-finder in the San Juan River to enumerate early, mid and late run salmon. Pairing the LiveScope with species composition data from the 4 Mile Hatchery fence and snorkel surveys will allow us to compare methods and potentially calibrate escapement estimates. Most of Pacheedaht’s community/Food, Social and Ceremonial (FSC) salmon harvest is directed at Coho due to prolonged low returns of Chinook; improved adult Coho enumeration (Late-run Coho in particular) has been identified by Pacheedaht as critical in order to sustainably manage their community Coho fishery.\nWe focus on Chinook due to the reasons mentioned previously (e.g., Rebuilding Plans) and for linkages to other programs currently funded under PSSI Pillar 1.1 such as Follow The Fish (DM Apps Project ID 2407) and Ecological Indicators (DM Apps Project ID 2414). Our budget reflects costs for expanding feasibility studies in Year 1 (2022-2023), including technician time to support not only San Juan work but also Ecological Indicators and occasionally Follow The Fish (we plan to share technician resources among all projects as much as possible). However, our work will also provide data on other salmon species in the San Juan watershed of interest to DFO and Pacheedaht. Pacheedaht employ a team of highly skilled technicians and biologists, and are well placed to eventually lead much of this work in future, following a brief period of investment, capacity building, and project development supported by DFO.\n⬅ Back to Home"

The San Juan River empties into Port San Juan (PFMA 20-2).\nPacheedaht First Nation’s Salmon Stewardship Program conducts monitoring and restoration work in and around the San Juan-Gordon watersheds to mitigate logging effects and rebuild salmon stocks. Their monitoring work spans the salmon lifecycle and includes investigating impacts of redd scour on egg-to- fry survival, documenting juvenile salmon habitat use in the estuary, and conducting adult spawner surveys. Recently, they have also launched a pilot Chinook mass-marking program with the 4 Mile Hatchery to reduce the impacts of hatchery genetics on the wild Chinook population through selective removals of adipose-clipped Chinook in terminal fisheries (community/FSC, and potentially sport).\nThese activities all inform the San Juan Chinook Rebuilding Plan currently in development by Pacheedaht, which will feed into the broader WCVI Chinook Rebuilding Plan in development by DFO (required under the Fish Stock Provisions Act for naturally-produced WCVI Chinook, due March 2024) (DFO 2022; Minister of Justice 2022). However, the recent WCVI Chinook Risk Assessment process identified several knowledge gaps, mostly related to early freshwater and marine life cycle stages. For San Juan Chinook specifically, juvenile data from these life stages (and interactions between hatchery and wild juveniles) are sparse, and spawner abundance data are limited in scope not only for Chinook, but also Coho and Chum.\nThese reasons make the San Juan River a good candidate to develop an integrated life history monitoring program in alignment with the larger Follow The Fish program. We propose to continue work initiated in 2022-2023 that collected data across four life stages of San Juan Chinook, thus complementing Pacheedaht’s established programs. First, we will implement a rotary screw trap to intercept naturally-produced out-migrating juveniles (all species, but focused on spring juvenile Chinook migration timing), allowing us to compare natural migration timing to hatchery release timing and to gather baseline biological traits relative to hatchery releases (e.g., size, condition). If funding and resources permit, a feasibility mark-recapture to obtain a relative abundance estimate for naturally-produced juvenile Chinook will be implemented. Second, we will conduct biweekly purse seining in Port San Juan during summer months (~May-August) to collect mixed-stock information, including hatchery/natural-origin of juvenile Chinook, stock ID, biological traits, environmental stress responses (through gill clips), relative abundance, and information on other species schooling with Chinook (e.g., Coho, Pacific Herring). Third, we will continue winter microtrolling work in Port San Juan that began in 2021 as part of the Follow The Fish project, which will collect detailed biological information (similar to purse seining data) on overwintering juvenile Chinook and Coho. We will also calibrate microtrolling and purse seining methods through simultaneous sampling events. Fourth, we will deploy a Garmin LiveScope hydroacoustic fish-finder in the San Juan River to enumerate early, mid and late run salmon. Pairing the LiveScope with species composition data from the 4 Mile Hatchery fence and snorkel surveys will allow us to compare methods and potentially calibrate escapement estimates. Most of Pacheedaht’s community/Food, Social and Ceremonial (FSC) salmon harvest is directed at Coho due to prolonged low returns of Chinook; improved adult Coho enumeration (Late-run Coho in particular) has been identified by Pacheedaht as critical in order to sustainably manage their community Coho fishery.\nWe focus on Chinook due to the reasons mentioned previously (e.g., Rebuilding Plans) and for linkages to other programs currently funded under PSSI Pillar 1.1 such as Follow The Fish (DM Apps Project ID 2407) and Ecological Indicators (DM Apps Project ID 2414). Our budget reflects costs for expanding feasibility studies in Year 1 (2022-2023), including technician time to support not only San Juan work but also Ecological Indicators and occasionally Follow The Fish (we plan to share technician resources among all projects as much as possible). However, our work will also provide data on other salmon species in the San Juan watershed of interest to DFO and Pacheedaht. Pacheedaht employ a team of highly skilled technicians and biologists, and are well placed to eventually lead much of this work in future, following a brief period of investment, capacity building, and project development supported by DFO.\n⬅ Back to Home"

WCVI Chinook are listed under bill C-68 and are threatened by local extinction and poor marine survival, with high mortality thought to occur during the early marine phase. Through the recent multi-stakeholder WCVI Chinook Salmon Marine Risk Assessment (MRA) process multiple data gaps were identified for potential factors that contribute to poor early marine survival. Many salmon surveys have been conducted over the years, but few have been able to access shallower areas within the sounds off the West Coast, where ocean-type Chinook may reside for up to their first year at sea. Characterizing environmental variables of these nearshore ecosystems in addition to the health and condition of residing Chinook salmon is critical to understanding which factors may be limiting survival. To address data gaps, in 2020 a highly collaborative assessment program in nearshore areas within Sounds on the WCVI was piloted to capture juvenile Chinook salmon in their first winter at sea using microtrolling technology. Building on the successful implementation and collaboration in this program, FtF aims to expand the assessment and monitoring of WCVI Chinook both spatially and temporally to track fish throughout their first year of life and identify limiting factors related to growth and size-specific survival. The FtF program will focus on assessing Chinook salmon originating from Stamp River, Sarita River and Nitinat River populations in Barkley Sound as indicators of WCVI Chinook. Stamp River is an existing indicator for WCVI Chinook, and existing programs and infrastructure can enable relatively high rates of juvenile captures across the early marine phase. Previous microtrolling efforts have demonstrated these populations are detected in nearshore areas throughout WCVI Sounds over the winter through capture of hatchery and wild fish. Although these populations are predominately hatchery origin fish, contrasts will be made, where possible, between wild and hatchery fish to understand how factors limiting survival and growth may differ. Salmon will be captured at multiple time points throughout their life cycle including in the Nitinat River Hatchery and Robertson Creek Hatchery, in-river (rotary screw trap and/or beach seining), in estuary (beach seining/purse seining), and in nearshore marine environments (purse seining/microtrolling). At each time point, individual fish will be sampled to assess health and condition (infectious agents, Fit-Chip gene expression profiles, stomach contents, contaminants, lengths, weights, and clinical signs) and stock of origin, paired with environmental data including physical oceanography (temperature, oxygen, pH salinity, fluorescence) and biological oceanography (chlorophyl, zooplankton). Scale samples from individual fish will be used to compare relative rates of growth, based on circulus spacing, across life stages and populations to assess the impact of health, condition and environmental factors. Otolith samples taken concurrently will be used to assess relative size-specific survival across time points and populations. This can be achieved by characterizing the fork length to otolith radius relationship for smolts at ocean entry and then using otolith microchemistry for individuals who survive to subsequent time points. Broad distributional trends in how WCVI Chinook migrate will be investigated with microtrolling by capturing Northward migrating Barkley origin fish in Clayoquot, Nootka, Kyuquot and Quatsino Sound. Chinook intercepted during microtrolling that are not of Sarita, Stamp or Nitinat origin will be similarly sampled for comparisons. Many current departmental research programs are collecting datasets on salmon populations and their ecosystems that can be incorporated into the FtF program for a comprehensive assessment of factors limiting survival of WCVI Chinook. FtF is in discussion and working alongside both internal and external collaborators to ensure datasets are integrated into FtF (see project linkages). Existing DFO datasets from researchers across branches will be synthesized alongside relevant datasets produced by external collaborators. Throughout our FtF project timeline, we aim to incorporate relevant datasets through new collaborations and outreach. This approach will highlight data gaps that are not currently being addressed through either departmental or external research groups and future research avenues. Data outputs from this program will directly contribute to the WCVI Chinook rebuilding plans and will be distributed across to project collaborators for use in their programs. Knowledge on differential size-specific survival both across the early marine phase and between wild and hatchery stocks will have impacts on SEP management decisions for hatcheries and may inform harvest strategies for WCVI Chinook populations. Characterizing differential growth across the early marine phase will have important implications for restoration activities (e.g., limited prey availability) and stock management e.g., (mitigating impacts on periods and areas of critical growth). Overall, data outputs can be incorporated into pre-season and in-season forecasting and other WCVI Chinook models.\n⬅ Back to Home"

A common paradigm is that poor marine survival has constrained recovery; however, the mechanisms (e.g. predation vs. starvation) leading to mortality and at which life stages they operate remain unclear. One specific hypothesis is that large aggregations of Steller sea lions intercept Fraser River sockeye salmon (10 of 24 CUs threatened or endangered (COSEWIC 2017)) north of Vancouver Island during return migrations. Yet little is known about sea lion foraging behaviour and diet in these remote transitions zones between offshore and coastal areas and even less is known about salmon mortality rates. Our proposal outlines a field program to addresses salmon and pinniped components simultaneously. This work will employ leading edge technologies to generate hard data on sources of salmon mortality and specifically the degree of pinniped mortality, moving us/debate/issue beyond the realm of conjecture and inference. Although this document describes a sockeye salmon-sea lion field program, we emphasize that our proposal is modular in that one or both species components can be pursued, and the framework could focus on alternative pinniped species, salmon species or salmon life stages based on departmental priorities (e.g. harbor seal impacts on juvenile Chinook salmon); however the costs associated with tagging juvenile salmonids will be considerably higher.\nWe will estimate sea lion predation on adult sockeye salmon as they migrate past Triangle Island, off the northern tip of Vancouver Island. This region is the site of the largest Steller sea lion rookery in the world and is hypothesized to be a survival bottleneck that disproportionately impacts Fraser River sockeye salmon productivity (e.g. Walters et al. 2020). Salmon- related work would quantify predation impacts via multiple complementary tagging technologies. After capturing sockeye salmon via purse seine near Haida Gwaii, we will use satellite tags to quantify guild-specific predation rates (e.g. cetacean, pinniped, shark) based on depth and temperature sensors, to generate high resolution estimates of salmon habitat use, and to estimate diversion rates that may moderate predation impacts (i.e. migrations through Juan de Fuca rather than Johnstone Strait). We will leverage existing acoustic telemetry infrastructure in the northern Strait of Georgia, that will increase the precision of mortality rate estimates at relatively low cost. Pinniped- related work will include complementary methods (fatty acids, stable isotopes and scats) to estimate diets at multiple temporal scales along migration pathways on either side of Vancouver Island. Pinniped diet analyses will be complemented by satellite tagging to understand movements, distribution and foraging behaviour in relation to salmon mortality locations. We wish to emphasize that these pinniped data will be highly relevant for gauging predator impacts more broadly, Including other PSSI initiatives.\nFor the salmon component, Y1 (FY 2023-24) will be a ramp-up period, with tagging occurring in Y2 and Y3. For the pinniped component, diet collections will begin in Y1 and continue through Y3. We will undertake initial satellite tagging of pinnipeds in Y1 to refine effective protocols and increase tagging rates in Y2 and Y3. Analytical pipelines for both components will be developed in Y2 so that final analyses can begin in Y3 and continue through 2026 (PIs have the capacity to complete analytical work without additional staffing). Unfortunately salmon tagging will occur during off cycle years; however we anticipate sufficient numbers of fish will be available to meet our sample size requirements.\nUltimately data on survival rates and predation are critical to several management questions. First, total survival rates can provide strategic information on whether specific life history stages are likely to constrain recovery (i.e. if survival is high then subsequent efforts should focus on other stages). Second, information on guild-specific predation rates can provide information on the utility of targeted management actions (e.g. fisheries, culls).

These acute stressor events are predicted to increase in both duration and frequency due to climate change (Frölicher et al., 2018). The proposed project will examine the impacts of warming and upwelling events (with acidified water) on the nutritional status of Limacina helicina, a cold- water pteropod that serves as an important dietary item for juvenile Pacific salmon species in the Northern Pacific (Brodeur et al., 2007; Doubleday & Hopcroft, 2015; Sturdevant et al., 2012). For example, dietary analyses of juvenile pink salmon and sockeye salmon within the Gulf of Alaska have shown a predominance of L. helicina (Brodeur et al., 2007; Doubleday & Hopcroft, 2015; Sturdevant et al., 2012). Research has demonstrated that shell development, growth, and survival of L. helicina are all highly susceptible to warming and ocean acidification (Manno et al., 2017), but there has been limited investigation of impacts to pteropod nutritional quality (i.e. composition) under the context of acute stressor events. Prey nutritional quality is a key aspect of feeding ecology that directly contributes to the survival of higher trophic species (Ahlgren et al., 2005; Daly et al., 2010). In salmon, variation in invertebrate prey quantity and quality may influence growth and survival, especially during early marine residence (Litz et al., 2019). Altered dietary lipid levels, for example, have been linked to changes in fish growth, fat deposition, and digestive enzyme activity (Pelusio et al., 2021). Consequently, we propose that any change in the nutritive status of L. helicina under climate stressor conditions could have carry-over impacts to juvenile salmon growth, health, and survival.\n⬅ Back to Home"

In salmon, variation in invertebrate prey quantity and quality may influence growth and survival, especially during early marine residence (Litz et al., 2019). Altered dietary lipid levels, for example, have been linked to changes in fish growth, fat deposition, and digestive enzyme activity (Pelusio et al., 2021). Consequently, we propose that any change in the nutritive status of L. helicina under climate stressor conditions could have carry-over impacts to juvenile salmon growth, health, and survival.\n⬅ Back to Home"

Thiamine is an essential vitamin for all organisms, that is derived from their diet. Deficiency is most overtly expressed in salmonids as early mortality of fry, but secondary effects impact all life stages. TDC was first observed in the North Pacific in 2014 when up to 70% of Chinook from the Yukon River, a system which has experienced declines in Chinook productivity, were found to have limiting levels of egg thiamine (Larson and Howard 2019; Honeyfield et al. 2016). In 2020, TDC was diagnosed for the first time in California Chinook and found responsible for excessive fry mortality. Despite its presence both north and south of BC, to date, only a single study has measured thiamine levels in BC salmon and this included just two Chinook (Welch et al. 2018). TDC may already be an important driver of BC Chinook salmon population declines, and is expected to be an increasingly important issue as oceans warm and prey communities change. Significantly, when TDC is diagnosed there are effective treatment strategies to mitigate the effects which can be applied in hatcheries to limit fry mortality. Assessment and monitoring, of Thiamine deficiency can be used by SEP and StAD to inform planning decisions for stocks where expectations of reduced spawning performance may be expected, e.g., SEP could use this information to focus egg collection efforts, or remediation actions such as Thiamine injection / baths, on stocks that may be at greater risk of low spawning success.

    "text": "Lead(s): Stewart Johnson\nDivision: Ecosystem Sciences (ESD)\nSection: Regional Ecosystems Effects on Fish and Fisheries\nLocation: [“PBS Nanaimo”]\nStatus: Ongoing\nTheme: Innovation & Diagnostics\nPSSI Pillar: 2-Salmon enhancement\nOverview:\nExposure of fish to stressors can elicit physiological changes at multiple levels of animal organization, these alterations are collectively known as the stress response. The hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis which is activated in response to most forms of stress in fish, initiates and regulates the stress response. In fish cortisol is the predominant glucocorticoid released as part of the primary stress response, and is critical for mediating adaptive metabolic, physiological, and behavioral adjustments. However, prolonged elevation of cortisol, due to extended or repeated exposure to stressors, can negatively affect fish behavior, growth, reproduction and immune functions (reviewed in Schreck and Tort, 2016).\nThe analysis of circulating (serum/plasma) cortisol is the most common method used in stress response assessments in fish. This method works well under controlled situations, where fish can be caught and rapidly sampled (within minutes to avoid the rapid increase in cortisol which occurs in response to capture stress) and it provides information on the acute stress response at the time of collection (immediate state of stress). However, to understand chronic stress the past cortisol history of individuals needs to be understood. Fish scales have been recently recognized as a biomaterial that accumulates cortisol, and other physiologically important hormones including cortisone, over long periods of time. Moreover, scale cortisol levels are not affected by stress associated with capture (reviewed in Laberge et al. 2019; Kennedy and Janz, 2023).\nCortisol is released from the interrenals in fish as a biologically active steroid hormone. At the tissue level, the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11βhsd2) converts cortisol into its biologically inactive metabolite, cortisone. Importantly, this step is irreversible in fish, highlighting the importance of 11βhsd2 in the regulation of cortisol levels in teleosts (Tsachaki et al. 2017). Since 11βhsd2 is present in fish skin, assessing the expression of this enzyme in the skin during chronic stress, and measuring both cortisol and cortisone content will provide critical context for scale cortisol deposition and clearance, and further validate the use of scales as an indicator of chronic stress in fish.\nWe are proposing the use of levels of stress hormones (cortisol, cortisone) in scales as a tool for routine monitoring of chronic stress in different life history stages of Pacific salmon. As an example, this tool could be used to examine individual and population effects of external stressors encountered during migration on cortisol dynamics, which has implications with respect to population resilience to stressors such as climate change. The use of scales is minimally invasive and therefore suitable for use in populations of conservation concern. However, to interpret values obtained from scales we first need to understand the temporal profile of stress hormone accumulation and rates of clearance in scales under different environmental conditions for the different species of Pacific Salmon.\nIn this project we will conduct laboratory and hatchery-based studies to determine/optimize: 1) sampling methods (e.g. study spatial heterogeneity of scale stress hormone content (SSHC)), 2) effects of acute vs. chronic stress on SSHC, 3) relationship between plasma and SSHC, 4) individual, stock and temporal variability in SSHC, including changes associated with smoltification, and 5) effects of unpredictable chronic stress on plasma and SSHC. We will use, and modify, if necessary, analytical methods for SSHC that have been used in studies of goldfish and rainbow trout (Laberge et al. 2019; Kennedy and Janz, 2023).\nLiterature Cited Herrera M. et al. 2019.

Traditional fish age estimations are determined by microscopically counting growth zones in a number of different hard structures including scales and otoliths, a highly specialized skill that requires years of training (Campana, 1992; Hesler et al., 2019). DFO Science Sclerochronology lab provides internal and external DFO clients with age estimates for numerous species of groundfish, pelagics, shellfish and salmon including chinook, coho, chum and sockeye. This information contributes to internal stock assessments and international treaties such as The Pacific Salmon Treaty. The Sclerochronology lab is currently transitioning from a team consisting of more senior agers to junior agers, a transition that will reduce the lab output capacity. As such, the Sclerochronology lab is investigating new methodologies with the potential of increasing fish ageing capacity and efficiency. Fourier Transform-Near Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-NIRS) has recently been applied to rapidly predict fish age, gaining attention among fisheries managers as a potential alternative to timely and costly production ageing of managed species (Passerotti et al., 2020). Age prediction capability of FT-NIRS has been tested on the otoliths of chinook salmon (Claiborne et al., 2019), walleye pollock (Hesler et al., 2019), red snapper (Passerotti et al., 2020), barramundi (Wright et al., 2021), Pacific cod (Healy et al., 2021), longnose skate (Arrington et al., 2021) as well as the vertebrae of two shark species (Rigby et al. 2014, 2016), with potentially promising results. Studies on eastern Bering Sea walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) have shown that ages derived from FT-NIRS are not only precise but may demonstrate less bias than traditional ageing methods (Helser et al., 2018).\nStudies conducted by collaborators at NOAA have indicated that FT-NIRS has the capacity to increase age outputs of walleye pollock from 35 ages per day to 360 ages per day (Hesler et al., 2019). If successful, new applications of FT- NIRS technology will provide a promising approach to consolidate research tools, operationalize timely data collection methods for age determination directly benefiting fisheries researchers and managers, as well as other research projects led by StAR, SEP, and Indigenous communities.\nThe overall objective of the proposed work is a proof of concept to establish that the FT-NIRS can be used to precisely estimate the age of fishes regularly assessed by the Sclerochronology lab, including the routinely aged salmon species of chinook, coho, chum, and sockeye. Since salmon are aged using scale structures, our research will first focus on fish species that are aged by otoliths. Once we are familiar with the equipment and techniques and have successfully passed the proof-of-concept phase, a range of new research questions can be investigated such as determining whether salmon scales can be scanned for precise age estimation.\n⬅ Back to Home"

Rebuilding the abundance of Okanagan Chinook is a priority for First Nations and local, provincial, and national fisheries agencies on both sides of the boarder.\nRecently, the Pacific Salmon Commission conducted a series of 5 workshops with fisheries professionals and First Nations which examined threats, impediments to survival, and mitigation approaches to increase the abundance of Okanagan Chinook. Similarly, a Recovery Potential Assessment (DFO Pacific Region CSAS) and DFO Risk Assessment Methods (RAMS) have been applied and also identified threats and mitigations. Among the issues identified in these assessments, the key ones include Climate Change and its influence on the thermal and hydrological regime of the Okanagan, channelization and the disconnection of the main river channels from the historic and off-channel stream habitats, and predation by invasive fish species. Two of the data gaps that were highlighted from this work are the juvenile habitat use in the Okanagan, which has been highly disturbed and degraded, and the level of predation on juvenile Chinook salmon by native and non-native fishes. To enable rebuilding it will be essential to have information on habitat use and to understand the threat posed by predation.

Holistic health will be monitored with the innovative salmon Fit-Chip technology developed by Dr. Miller’s laboratory. Fit-Chips can simultaneously monitor pathogen RNA and host biomarkers predictive of specific stressor (thermal, osmotic, oxygen), disease (viral disease, inflammatory response, immune activation, imminent mortality), and developmental (pre-smolt, smolt, de-smolt) states in salmon based on profiling from non-lethal (in smolt-size fish) gill biopsy samples. This study will continue to collaboratively develop a purpose-built SEP Fit-Chip that incorporates the biomarker panels with assays to key pathogens of interest to SEP.\nOBJECTIVE 1: We will apply Fit-Chip technology proactively, establishing baseline data from the two hatcheries where Chinook tanks/ponds will be sampled and immediately analyzed monthly post hatch until release. Where issues with animal welfare arise, more frequent sampling can be undertaken (see objective 4). With these data, we can assess shifts in health status over time, identify potential physiological factors, stressors or pathogens associated with elevated mortality, and measure physiological outcomes of mitigation steps or shifts in husbandry practices. Fit-Chips will also be applied to stage smolt readiness to minimize osmotic stress and maximize survivorship upon release. Fit-Chips will also be applied to fish held in sea pens (live and moribund where possible) to assess adaptation post-release and to identify factors contributing to physiological shifts in moribund fish. Post-release from sea pens, a sister project integrated with the WCVI “Follow the Fish” (FtF) PSSI research team will fund application of Fit-Chips to monitor shifts in health status over the 2-3 months Chinook spend in river and estuarine environments (removed from the budget herein), and the first year of marine rearing. Importantly, the imminent mortality biomarker panel, which can predict natural mortality within 72 hours, will provide a means to assess shifts in survival during post-release rearing.\nOBJECTIVE 2: At the same time that fish are being collected in hatchery, replicate filtered water samples will be collected for environmental (e)RNA assessments using the same Fit-Chip technology. eRNA has already proven to be highly useful for (live) pathogen monitoring, but we will also explore if shifts in the health of fish in tanks and net-pens can be observed at a population level by the shed salmon RNA comparable to the established assessment of individuals. If this were the case, eRNA assessments would provide a completely non-invasive tool to track health and condition of cultured fish. For net pen samples (and post-release samples funded in the sister FtF PSSI project [removed from budget herein], eDNA/RNA will be collected and metabarcode sequencing will be applied to identify the species compositions (salmon spp., prey, competitors, predators, pathogens) that comprise the natural environments for Nitinat and Robertson Creek smolt releases. Note that results from the first year are just coming in on the eRNA objective, and look quite promising. To increase sensitivity, however, we are doubling the eRNA filters to collect water samples as due to constant feeding towards the end of production, we were unable to get a full 5L filtrate for each filter, which reduced the sensitivity to detect fish RNA. We will work with hatcheries to try to reduce feeding the hour before sampling and double up on filters to resolve this issue.\nOBJECTIVE 3: In order to maximize the relevance of the holistic health assessments, production, husbandry, and environmental data will need to be provided by SEP to facilitate association-based analysis of the Fit-Chip and eRNA data. In the first year, we began the development of a purpose-built SEP Genomic database and starting writing R-Markdown scripts to automatically produce the data graphics for reporting back. We did not have salary for this objective in the budget in the first year, which slowed progress, so this year we are adding 1 month for database support (Llewellyn) and 1 month for analytical support (Bass) to ensure time is dedicated to this task so that rapid turn-around for Fit-Chip results back to hatchery managers (&lt;2 weeks if no urgent event, &lt;1week for responsive sampling (e.g. mortalities, release decisions). “eRNA” technology can also include swab sampling to find sources of live pathogens if a particular infectious disease outbreak occurs. Given the potential to introduce new pathogens/parasites with transitions from ground to natural river/lake water sources, eRNA will be collected prior to transitioning to conduct a thorough assessment of infective agents that may be introduced; those detected will be added to Fit-Chip panels thereafter to assess whether hatchery fish become infected (myxozoans present the highest risk of introduction).\n⬅ Back to Home"

Objectives of hatchery enhancement span conserving at-risk stocks, rebuilding lower abundance stocks, providing harvest opportunities and increasing public awareness through outreach and education. However, there are also risks associated with hatchery enhancement; differences between a hatchery and a natural habitat affect both the genetic and environmental factors that shape the performance and fitness of salmon. Consequently, hatchery-origin salmon may be less suited to wild habitats than their natural-origin counterparts, and the presence of hatchery-origin fish on a natural spawning ground may reduce the fitness of a population overall. The relative fitness of hatchery-origin compared to natural-origin salmon has been estimated in a handful of systems through determination of relative reproductive success (RRS). In these studies, returning adults are assigned back to their parents using genetic tags called parentage-based tags, and RRS is inferred by the number of returns per family from hatchery-origin compared to natural-origin parents. In general, the results of RRS studies suggest that hatchery-origin fish have lower natural reproductive success than natural- origin fish, and this reduced RRS is potentially transferred across generations. Despite this pattern, the extent to which hatchery-origin fitness is lower than natural-origin fitness is likely dependent on current and historical factors impacting specific systems, including hatchery practices. To date, no study has estimated the RRS of hatchery- and natural-origin Pacific salmonids in integrated populations enhanced by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). This is a critical knowledge gap for effectively managing hatchery production, as genetic management of these systems currently assumes a RRS of 0.8. This value is a reasonable consensus value from published estimates in USA rivers, but the SEP has had clear guidelines for genetic management since at least the 1980s, and it is possible that RRS estimates from USA hatcheries are inaccurate for SEP hatcheries. Utilization of an inaccurate RRS estimate could result in mismanagement of genetic risks associated with hatchery production, because the number of hatchery-origin fish that are predicted to utilize the natural spawning grounds increases as RRS increases, whereas a high RRS infers relatively low negative consequences for fitness associated with hatchery- origin spawners. Therefore, accurate estimation of RRS is important for effective genetic management of SEP hatcheries, particularly in the context of managing the influences of the hatchery and natural environments on the adaptive trajectories of integrated populations (i.e., proportionate natural influence or “PNI”). The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Initiate extensive genetic sampling of both the escapement and broodstock for at least one Pacific salmon population enhanced by the SEP (confirmed population: Sarita River Chinook Salmon). 2) Use a genetic biomarker panel to genotype these natural-origin and hatchery-origin parents. 3) Explore alternative approaches to enable widespread RRS estimation across SEP hatcheries even in systems where extensively escapement sampling is infeasible. The long-term objectives of the study are: 4) Explore options to increase sampling efforts to approach comprehensive escapement sampling in future years. 5) Continue these genetic sampling efforts to derive parentage-based tags for returning adults from both hatchery-origin and natural-origin production. 6) Estimate RRS in SEP hatcheries to allow improved management of genetic risks associated with hatchery influences.\n⬅ Back to Home"

Consequently, hatchery-origin salmon may be less suited to wild habitats than their natural-origin counterparts, and the presence of hatchery-origin fish on a natural spawning ground may reduce the fitness of a population overall. Despite the known risks and consequences of hatchery enhancement, major genetic differences between hatchery-origin and natural-origin salmonids as a result of hatchery-mediated selection or relaxed selection have generally not been observed in integrated populations. In contrast, substantial epigenetic differences have been detected between hatchery-origin and natural-origin Pacific salmonids. Epigenetic variants are structural changes to DNA without a change in the DNA sequence itself. For example, DNA methylation is a commonly studied epigenetic mechanism in which a methyl group (-CH3) is covalently added to a cytosine residue. These modifications to DNA can alter the function of the genome, particularly through the regulation of gene expression. Given the extent of variation in epigenetic signatures between hatchery-origin and natural-origin salmon, the functional effects of epigenetic variants are excellent candidates to underlie the fitness consequences associated with hatchery enhancement. Additionally, it is possible for hatchery epigenetic variants to be inherited by the offspring of hatchery-origin fish, which aligns with the potential for long-term reductions in population fitness as hatchery-origin fish spawn in natural habitats. The study of epigenetic variation in Pacific salmonids is relatively in its infancy, but epigenetic biomarkers are a promising tool to facilitate managing hatchery enhancement specifically and salmon fisheries generally. A critical knowledge gap in the generation of these tools is that epigenetic differences between hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook Salmon have not been well-characterized within enhanced populations or across populations enhanced by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). Therefore, a comprehensive examination of DNA methylation between hatchery- and natural-origin Canadian Chinook Salmon is a high priority, which will be followed by the development of epigenetic biomarkers and tools for monitoring and management. The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Identify hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook Salmon in broodstock from five SEP hatcheries through assignments of parentage-based tags (confirmed hatchery lines: Nicola River, Quinsam River, Sarita River, Atnarko River Upper, Chilliwack River Fall, Chilliwack River Summer). 2) Utilize enzymatic methyl sequencing to assess DNA methylation patterns among female and male hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook Salmon across difference age classes of return. 3) Determine hatchery-origin epigenetic variants that are: common across all hatcheries studied, specific to individual hatcheries, associated with physiological performance, associated with sex, or associated with age of return. 4) Identify candidate epigenomic biomarkers for use in high-throughput molecular tools to support monitoring and management decisions. The long-term objectives of the study are: 5) Develop high- throughput molecular tools to screen epigenetic biomarkers in Chinook Salmon (e.g. pyrosequencing, eDNA methylation sequencing) 6) Expand the regional coverage of hatchery lines assessed to confirm generality of hatchery-origin variants across SEP programming. 7) Fully assess and resolve regional and hatchery specific epigenetic differences between hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook Salmon to support high-resolution targeted monitoring efforts. 8) Investigate the temporal and environmental sensitivity of hatchery-origin epigenetic variants, and the extent to which hatchery-origin epigenetic variants occur across tissue types. 9) Examine the establishment of hatchery- origin epigenetic variants through stages of hatchery production. 10) Assess epigenomic patterns that could be used to indicate the age of hatchery-origin Chinook Salmon in SEP enhancement lines.\n⬅ Back to Home"

To understand whether this process impacts other fjord systems, a PhD student (Ehsan Tighizadeh) who is jointly situated int he Natural Resources and Environmental Studies Graduate Program at the University of Northern British Columbia and Fisheries and Oceans Canada will expand this study to cover the entire British Columbia coast. Specifically, they will reconstruct the historical climatology of Arctic outflow winds and their impact on fjord waters along the BC coast. Through this work, it is anticipated that other marine refugia created by Arctic outflow winds will be identified.\n⬅ Back to Home"

    "text": "Lead(s): Terri Sutherland\nDivision: Ecosystem Sciences (ESD)\nSection: Nearshore Ecosystems\nLocation: N/A\nStatus: New\nTheme: Unspecified\nPSSI Pillar: Unspecified\nOverview:\nMillions of Fraser River salmon rely on Roberts Bank tidal flats for food, shelter, and salinity acclimatization before they undergo a multi-year migration across the Pacific Ocean for many years. Since harpacticoids provide a link between primary production (benthic diatom biofilms) and tertiary production at higher trophic levels (salmon-smolts, sandpipers), harpacticoids can transfer diatom-derived a high-quality food consisting of long-chain polysaccharide unsaturated fatty-acids (LC-PUFAs) that serve as a high-quality migration fuel for salmon smolts. However, modelling scenarios of salinity estimates on Roberts Bank shows a salinity regime shift towards freshwater 34% relative to that of the existing tidal flats conditions between pre- and post- construction of Roberts Bank Terminal-2 (RBT2). On Roberts Bank, the alignment of diatom-harpacticoid-salmon trophic levels and transfer of LC-PUFAs across trophic levels must be sustained to avoid a potential “match–mismatch” scenario (McKinnell and Irvine, 2021). This timely pairing of predator and prey is also crucial for 1.5 million Western sandpipers (Caldris mauri), that migrate between Panama to Alaska annually (April 15 – May 15) and stopover on Roberts Bank tidal flats. Western sandpipers also rely on diatom biofilms (LC- PUFAs) for fuel for the long migration to Alaska (Warnock and Bishop, 1998; Elner et al, 2005; Kuwae et al. 2008; Mathot et al. 2010). Given the overlap of 1) migration stopover location and timing for both salmon and sandpipers on Roberts Bank; and 2) similar prey preferences (benthic diatom biofilms) and required LC-PUFAs for migration fuel, a competitive interaction may occur under these circumstances, leading to a match-mismatch scenario for both benthic diatom predators. Furthermore, the predicted reduction of salinity due to RBT2 construction during the season of freshet and migration stopovers of both salmon and sandpiper, may apply a significant environmental stressor to this competition for high-quality food.\n⬅ Back to Home"

Pacific salmon populations are known to display local adaptation, such that native spawners are typically better suited to their local habitat than non-native spawners. This can be exacerbated for strays from populations that are integrated with hatchery enhancement, because hatchery adaptation can further reduce fitness in natural environments. Previous work on West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook Salmon has demonstrated that strays from several major production facilities have interbreed with natural populations in other rivers, resulting in introgression of hatchery genetic variation and homogenization of population- level variation. This work was conducted in the mid-2010s and utilized only ~12-15 genetic biomarkers, providing low density estimates of this introgression. Low density estimates may mischaracterize the extent of introgression, and cannot inform either the repeatability of introgression, or the potential maladaptive consequences across different genomics regions. In this project, we propose to update the estimates of introgression from Robertson Creek and Conuma River Hatcheries among WCVI Chinook Salmon populations, and to assess introgression with a high-density genomic sequencing strategy to provide high resolution estimates of hatchery introgression. The results of this work will inform advice processes regarding management of hatchery strays and adaptive influences at levels above individual populations (e.g., conservations units).\n⬅ Back to Home"
