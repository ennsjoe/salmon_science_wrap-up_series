This study will utilize best practices developed in the previous study to better understand FRIM in the recreational Coho fishery on West Coast Vancouver Island, and will be further advanced by a new component to study affects of fisheries interactions on fish metabolism. This information will be used to expand the Best Practices Handbook developed in 2020."

We will use PIT-tagging to estimate survival, and combine these estimates with individual-based measures of environmental stress using cutting-edge gene-expression tools (“Fit-Chips”). Additionally, we will monitor environmental DNA (eDNA) to determine key rearing habitats, availability of prey, and presence of predators and pathogens across spatial and temporal scales.\nOur project will fill key information gaps pertaining to at-risk Chinook populations, prescribed for rebuilding under the Fisheries Act. Ultimately, the findings will help to inform targeted habitat restoration, protection, and enhancement efforts for WCVI Chinook salmon. Adding to ongoing collaborations with WCVI First Nations, DFO, local NGOs, and PSF’s Salmon Bottlenecks project, we will leverage extensive experience, expertise, and infrastructure already in place to deliver the most comprehensive investigation to date of early marine survival in WCVI Chinook salmon."

Changes could include increasingly extreme flow levels (low and high), high water temperatures, and hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen), which all pose as potential hazards to salmon survival across various life stages.

Historically, heart and chevron shaped traps were used extensively by First Nation communities along the estuary to capture adult salmon prior to the development of commercial fisheries. Recent revitalization of fish traps as a terminal fishery in other areas along the coast has been shown to be successfully at catching and selectively harvest hatchery marked salmon species while releasing wild (unmarked) salmon and steelhead of conservation concern. Partnering with We Wai Kai First Nation, Wei Wai Kum First Nation, LGL Limited, and the Wild Fish Conservancy; the initiative will develop First Nations’ capacity for sustainable salmon stewardship through the development of the best selective harvest fishing methods possible in traditional fishing areas while preserving wild stocks of conservation concern."

The goals of the 2023-2026 project are to develop up to seven indigenous led watershed connectivity remediation plans in Pacific salmon habitat; update three existing watershed connectivity remediation plans; improve the habitat suitability modelling and assessment techniques for BC salmon to allow for better prediction of important spawning and rearing habitat areas disconnected by both longitudinal and lateral barriers in conjunction with UNBC; identify and rank the most important barriers to fish passage caused by rail infrastructure and initiate development of an action plan to restore access to spawning and rearing habitat that is currently cut off by rail stream crossings; and improve the knowledge and application of best practices for stream crossings among practitioners in government and the private sector to prevent future unintended fragmentation of habitat through the development of a short course and supporting resources relating to stream crossings. Target areas for watershed plans include the Bowron River and Quesnel River watersheds as well as other yet to be determined."

    "text": "Species Group: Pacific Salmon\nLocation: Broughton Archipelago.\nPartners: None listed\nAgreement Period: March 07, 4610301 to October 07, 4861522\nSession(s): Freshwater Stressors\nPresentation Date(s): December 02, 2025\nSpeakers: Amy Kamarainen\nOverview:\nThe project will be four components (i) provide a quantitative and qualitative history of forestry and salmon in Musgamagw Dzawada’enuxw territory, (ii) quantify the effects of forest harvesting histories on salmon abundance for all Pacific salmon species in coastal BC, (iii) establish a temperature, sedimentation, and dissolved oxygen monitoring system in salmon watersheds of Musgamagw Dzawada’enuxw territory to quantify stream temperatures and water quality in relation to forestry activity and support a centralized database of stream temperatures coast-wide initiated by the PSF, and (iv) develop a new non-invasive method for studying salmon stress responses using environmental DNA technology and applies it to salmon in relation to temperature and environmental variation across watersheds in Musgamagw Dzawada’enuxw territory. The project components will thus provide proximate empirical data on the environmental conditions of salmon habitats, salmon stress, growth, and immune responses to their stream environments, as well as population level relationships from salmon and forestry timeseries. The outcomes of the project will provide detailed histories of forestry and salmon in the watersheds of Musgamagw Dzawada’enuxw territory, new fieldwork with which to analyze how forestry practices and history interact with climate change to affect salmon, and a quantitative analysis of salmon population responses to forestry histories across the full British Columbia coast."
