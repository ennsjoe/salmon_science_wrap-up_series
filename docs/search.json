The present study focused on the Northeast Pacific coastal region where coinciding rises in mean seasonal seawater temperatures and increasingly prevalent acute stressor events, such as heatwaves and low-pH upwellings, are occurring. Limacina helicina, a cold-water pteropod species of high abundance within the region’s zooplankton communities, is highly susceptible to climate change stressors, with documented impacts of ocean warming and acidification, including altered shell development, growth, and survival. To date, however, there has been minimal investigation of climate change effects on the species’ nutritional status under regionally-relevant conditions, thereby contributing to a continued lack of understanding of how climate change impacts at lower trophic levels may relay across wider ecosystems. To begin to address this, we examined the survival and fatty acid profile of L. helicina under future conditions via a laboratory experiment during which pteropods were exposed to singular and coinciding warming (mean summer seawater temperature + 4°C) and low-pH (~1500 ppm pCO2; Ωarag = 0.53) conditions, with fatty acid analyses carried out via gas chromatography at 48-h and 5-d timepoints. Results indicated a significant impact of pCO2 on pteropod nutritional status at 48 h and a significant impact of temperature on survival at 5 d. Additionally, fatty acid analyses of historical plankton samples, collected in the region over 2014–2023, were carried out to examine time-series changes in pteropod fatty acid profiles in relation to temperature records. Results indicated significant differences in a number of fatty acid fractions between year groups, and in the overall fatty acid profiles of a number of year groups (2016 and 2019; 2018 and 2021), the latter findings parallelled by minor to moderate divergences in seasonal temperature conditions. Overall, findings suggest that short-term low-pH upwelling events and, to a lesser degree, changing seawater temperature conditions may result in altered fatty acid composition in pteropods, potentially leading to shifts in nutritional quality and associated impacts on trophic energy transfer."

The SWP team has engaged with First Nations organizations, government scientists, and independent experts to compile and analyse data on salmon abundance, catch, productivity, and broad-scale habitat pressures to inform standardized assessments of biological status and habitat threats for Pacific salmon Conservation Units. By making data and assessments readily accessible, the SWP has supported numerous organizations, including COSEWIC, Ocean Wise, and the Central Coast Indigenous Resource Alliance, in decision-making for salmon conservation, management, and recovery."

    "text": "Species Group: Pacific Salmon\nLocation: Pacific Ocean\nPartners: Dr. Steve Cooke (Carleton University); Ocean Tracking Network Canada\nOrganization: Pacific Salmon Ecology and Conservation Laboratory, UBC\nSession(s): Fisheries Monitoring And Harvest Methods\nPresentation Date(s): December 09, 2025\nSpeakers: Steve Johnston\nAbstract:\nCatch-and-release (CR) practices are a key component of fisheries management and have the potential to be increasingly used in future management scenarios. However, mortality associated with CR may be highly variable and influenced by environmental, physiological, and handling-related factors associated with marine recreational fisheries. Post-release mortality estimates used in management frameworks are based on studies that lacked the temporal and spatial scope necessary to define these rates. Our seven-year project has combined both telemetry tracking and holding study components to develop a wholesome understanding of the post-release experience of Chinook and coho salmon, and the factors that influence both short- and long-term mortality. Using acoustic telemetry, we tracked more than 1,800 Chinook and coho salmon captured and released by anglers along the BC coast to quantify post-release mortality. Additionally, we captured 730 Chinook and coho salmon and monitored their survival in land-based holding tanks for a minimum of 10 days to observe more specific mechanisms of mortality. We found that injury type and handling methods were key predictors of mortality, with blood loss, scale loss, and fin damage having more immediate effects, while eye injuries were more likely to drive latent mortality responses. Overall, Chinook salmon were more resilient to fishery interactions, and coho salmon were more susceptible to injuries related to fishery handling. We have produced 15 best-practice recommendations for anglers participating in marine recreational fisheries where one can expect to be required to release non-target individuals.\nBio:\nStephen Johnston, PhD Candidate and Wall Legacy Fellow, Pacific Salmon Ecology and Conservation Laboratory, UBC\nCollaborators:\nSport Fishing Institute of British Columbia, Bamfield Marine Science Centre, Ocean Tracking Network, Pacific Salmon Foundation, Kintama Research, Gillard Pass Fisheries Society"

Sagittal otoliths are essential sensory structures that enable fish to hear and maintain balance. Normally composed of aragonite, a calcium carbonate polymorph, otoliths sometimes contain inclusions of vaterite—an abnormal polymorph. While vateritic otoliths occur in less than 10% of wild-origin salmon, they are extremely common in hatchery fish, affecting 60–80% of individuals. Vaterite deposition impairs otolith function and hearing, potentially compromising marine survival and the effectiveness of hatchery restoration programs. Despite long-standing recognition of vateritic otoliths, the causes of their formation remain poorly understood. Our research investigates which hatchery-rearing conditions promote vateritic otolith formation in juvenile coho salmon and examines the consequences of these deformities for survival.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Division: Ocean Sciences (OSD)\nSection: Ecology and Biogeochemistry\nOrganization: DFO\nSession(s): Follow The Fish\nPresentation Date(s): December 04, 2025\nSpeakers: Nicole LaForge, Micah Quindazzi\nAbstract:\nMicrochemistry of fish otoliths (calcium carbonate ear crystals) is a very useful tool for tracking habitat usage. IOS currently has the only instrumentation and expertise within DFO to carry out this type of analysis. During this project we developed a method for relating the size (fork lengths) of juvenile WCVI Chinook Salmon at estuary entry to their otolith radii, and using it to back-calculate the estuary fork lengths of returning adult spawners using Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) for PSSI priority river systems including Sarita, Robertson/Stamp and Nitinat from 2015-2023. We found that, generally, there are two types of natural origin (NO) outmigrants: those that leave the river early at small fork lengths, and those that use the river for longer and thus leave later and at larger fork lengths. In the Sarita River, these life history types emerge as Early Small NO smolts that leave the river under 50 mm between February to April, and Late Large NO smolts that leave the river above 50 mm after April. These Late Large NO smolts can survive up to 20X better than the Early Small smolts, 40% better than the hatchery origin smolts and comprise a much larger proportion of the returning spawners than would be expected considering that they represent around 5% of the outmigrants in the Sarita River system. While Late Large NO smolts survived better, the Early Small NO smolts comprised over 80% of the oldest Chinook salmon in the system. Otolith microchemistry provides a cost-effective means of gleaning information on the life histories of salmonids that can enhance our understanding and inform population rebuilding strategies, and demonstrates that NO Chinook Salmon provide significant phenotypic diversity, which would not be possible to replicate with hatchery production alone and provide a buffer against population extinction events.

IOS currently has the only instrumentation and expertise within DFO to carry out this type of analysis. During this project we developed a method for relating the size (fork lengths) of juvenile WCVI Chinook Salmon at estuary entry to their otolith radii, and using it to back-calculate the estuary fork lengths of returning adult spawners using Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) for PSSI priority river systems including Sarita, Robertson/Stamp and Nitinat from 2015-2023. We found that, generally, there are two types of natural origin (NO) outmigrants: those that leave the river early at small fork lengths, and those that use the river for longer and thus leave later and at larger fork lengths. In the Sarita River, these life history types emerge as Early Small NO smolts that leave the river under 50 mm between February to April, and Late Large NO smolts that leave the river above 50 mm after April. These Late Large NO smolts can survive up to 20X better than the Early Small smolts, 40% better than the hatchery origin smolts and comprise a much larger proportion of the returning spawners than would be expected considering that they represent around 5% of the outmigrants in the Sarita River system. While Late Large NO smolts survived better, the Early Small NO smolts comprised over 80% of the oldest Chinook salmon in the system. Otolith microchemistry provides a cost-effective means of gleaning information on the life histories of salmonids that can enhance our understanding and inform population rebuilding strategies, and demonstrates that NO Chinook Salmon provide significant phenotypic diversity, which would not be possible to replicate with hatchery production alone and provide a buffer against population extinction events. We conclude that there are significant carry-over effects from freshwater to the marine environment affecting WCVI Chinook entry timing and size, which may also correlate to their health.\nBio:\nNicole LaForge is a scientist who studies the microchemistry of biological tissues such as fish otoliths at the Institute of Ocean Sciences (IOS) for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) in Sidney, BC.

Take “wild salmon”: locally it can mean natural-origin fish, fish spawning naturally this year (including hatchery-origin spawners), or simply adipose-intact fish—definitions that change counts and benchmarks and challenge regional analyses. This fragmentation slows management, obscures accountability, and undermines confidence in otherwise excellent science. What’s needed is a shared vocabulary and an agreed-upon map of salmon terms—clear definitions and relationships that connect local labels to common meanings so people and software interpret data the same: a shared dictionary and rulebook for salmon data, an ontology. The DFO Salmon Ontology provides that map of how terms relate, and the controlled vocabularies that underpin it supply precise definitions—showing where terms differ, how they align, and where they should converge. Together, they standardize key terms across programs and regions. Teams can map local terms once, keep source systems unchanged yet aligned regionally, and link inputs to methods, benchmarks, and policy thresholds for Fisheries Science Reports, the Fish Stock Provisions, and the Wild Salmon Policy. Developed by the Fishery & Assessment Data Section in the Pacific Region Science Branch, this work builds on the International Year of the Salmon Data Mobilization initiative and collaborations with the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (U.S.) and the global Research Data Alliance. It is open source and implements community standards from the W3C, OBO Foundry, and Darwin Core. By removing terminology friction, it prepares us for AI-assisted data integration and cross-discipline interoperability while immediately letting biologists spend less time cleaning data.
