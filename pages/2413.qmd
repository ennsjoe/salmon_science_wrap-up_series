## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Akash Sastri, Kelly Young  
**Division:** Ocean Sciences (OSD)  
**Section:** Ecology and Biogeochemistry  
**Location:** ["Barkley Sound","Clayoquot Sound"]  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Ecosystem Monitoring  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  
**Speaker Theme:** Marine ecosystems and stressors  

**Overview:**  
Barkley Sound and the adjacent continental shelf region is rich in marine life
and has been established as a critical habitat area by DFO. Multiple species
designated as either &quot;Endangered&quot; or &quot;Special Concern&quot; use the productive
waters of Barkley Sound and adjacent shelf for all or part of their life
histories. Zooplankton are a foundational component of the area&#39;s marine food
webs, with the zooplankton taxon known as &quot;krill&quot; or &quot;euphausiids&quot; of critical
importance for the survival of several SARA-listed species including chinook.
Thus, the fortunes of krill populations are inextricably tied to those of the
taxa that depend on them. This proposal aims to build on previous studies in
the region to take a deep dive into the status and interannual trends of krill
populations and examine how ocean conditions influence interannual trends and
the seasonal cycle of krill distribution and abundance. Armed with an improved
awareness of the dynamics of krill populations, we will better be able to
anticipate and adapt to the associated variation of the taxa that depend on
them. Generally speaking, our work aims to fill the knowledge gap regarding
krill as an important prey item for juvenile salmon in both Barkley and
Clayoquot Sounds.
