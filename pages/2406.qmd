## üß¨ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Sophia Johannessen  
**Division:** Ocean Sciences (OSD)  
**Section:** Ecology and Biogeochemistry  
**Location:** N/A  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Climate Vulnerability  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  

**Overview:**  
The project will investigate whether the type of primary productivity has
changed in BC coastal waters (e.g. a change from a short, diatom-based food
chain to a longer food chain based on smaller phytoplankton), as a consequence
of climate change. Such a change is thought to have occurred in Puget Sound,
with negative effects on the early marine survival of juvenile salmon. The
proposed collaboration, involving a geochemical oceanographer (SJ) and
biological oceanographers from Canada (AS) and the United States (CK), will
permit a multidisciplinary approach to the research question. The project
leverages existing samples, data and monitoring programs. It combines data
from new and existing sediment and seawater samples with a trend analysis of
archived taxonomic data. It will expand the geographic and temporal overage of
existing data, while adding new biomarker analysis (sterols and fatty acids).
It is crucial for managers to understand the causes of trends and variability
in salmon populations in order to set catch limits. This project will
determine whether a change in primary productivity (‚Äúcarrying capacity‚Äù) could
be responsible for observed long-term declines in some species of salmon.
