**Overview:**  
This research is the second year of a proof of concept level adoption of a
modernized approach to conduct proactive holistic assessments of salmon health
and infectious agents in two SEP hatcheries: Robertson Creek and Nitinat.
Holistic health will be monitored with the innovative salmon Fit-Chip
technology developed by Dr. Miller‚Äôs laboratory. Fit-Chips can simultaneously
monitor pathogen RNA and host biomarkers predictive of specific stressor
(thermal, osmotic, oxygen), disease (viral disease, inflammatory response,
immune activation, imminent mortality), and developmental (pre-smolt, smolt,
de-smolt) states in salmon based on profiling from non-lethal (in smolt-size
fish) gill biopsy samples. This study will continue to collaboratively develop
a purpose-built SEP Fit-Chip that incorporates the biomarker panels with
assays to key pathogens of interest to SEP.

OBJECTIVE 1: We will apply Fit-Chip technology proactively, establishing
baseline data from the two hatcheries where Chinook tanks/ponds will be
sampled and immediately analyzed monthly post hatch until release. Where
issues with animal welfare arise, more frequent sampling can be undertaken
(see objective 4). With these data, we can assess shifts in health status over
time, identify potential physiological factors, stressors or pathogens
associated with elevated mortality, and measure physiological outcomes of
mitigation steps or shifts in husbandry practices. Fit-Chips will also be
applied to stage smolt readiness to minimize osmotic stress and maximize
survivorship upon release. Fit-Chips will also be applied to fish held in sea
pens (live and moribund where possible) to assess adaptation post-release and
to identify factors contributing to physiological shifts in moribund fish.
Post-release from sea pens, a sister project integrated with the WCVI ‚ÄúFollow
the Fish‚Äù (FtF) PSSI research team will fund application of Fit-Chips to
monitor shifts in health status over the 2-3 months Chinook spend in river and
estuarine environments (removed from the budget herein), and the first year of
marine rearing. Importantly, the imminent mortality biomarker panel, which can
predict natural mortality within 72 hours, will provide a means to assess
shifts in survival during post-release rearing.

OBJECTIVE 2: At the same time that fish are being collected in hatchery,
replicate filtered water samples will be collected for environmental (e)RNA
assessments using the same Fit-Chip technology. eRNA has already proven to be
highly useful for (live) pathogen monitoring, but we will also explore if
shifts in the health of fish in tanks and net-pens can be observed at a
population level by the shed salmon RNA comparable to the established
assessment of individuals. If this were the case, eRNA assessments would
provide a completely non-invasive tool to track health and condition of
cultured fish. For net pen samples (and post-release samples funded in the
sister FtF PSSI project [removed from budget herein], eDNA/RNA will be
collected and metabarcode sequencing will be applied to identify the species
compositions (salmon spp., prey, competitors, predators, pathogens) that
comprise the natural environments for Nitinat and Robertson Creek smolt
releases. Note that results from the first year are just coming in on the eRNA
objective, and look quite promising. To increase sensitivity, however, we are
doubling the eRNA filters to collect water samples as due to constant feeding
towards the end of production, we were unable to get a full 5L filtrate for
each filter, which reduced the sensitivity to detect fish RNA. We will work
with hatcheries to try to reduce feeding the hour before sampling and double
up on filters to resolve this issue.

OBJECTIVE 3: In order to maximize the relevance of the holistic health
assessments, production, husbandry, and environmental data will need to be
provided by SEP to facilitate association-based analysis of the Fit-Chip and
eRNA data. In the first year, we began the development of a purpose-built SEP
Genomic database and starting writing R-Markdown scripts to automatically
produce the data graphics for reporting back. We did not have salary for this
objective in the budget in the first year, which slowed progress, so this year
we are adding 1 month for database support (Llewellyn) and 1 month for
analytical support (Bass) to ensure time is dedicated to this task so that
rapid turn-around for Fit-Chip results back to hatchery managers (&lt;2 weeks if
no urgent event, &lt;1week for responsive sampling (e.g. mortalities, release
decisions). ‚ÄúeRNA‚Äù technology can also include swab sampling to find sources
of live pathogens if a particular infectious disease outbreak occurs. Given
the potential to introduce new pathogens/parasites with transitions from
ground to natural river/lake water sources, eRNA will be collected prior to
transitioning to conduct a thorough assessment of infective agents that may be
introduced; those detected will be added to Fit-Chip panels thereafter to
assess whether hatchery fish become infected (myxozoans present the highest
risk of introduction).
