title: "Developing a proactive, modernized, holistic approach to ensure optimal health and condition of Hatchery Production"
description: "A proactive holistic health monitoring approach based on high throughput molecular technologies has been validated for utility in two salmon enhancement hatcheries, and is now ready for minimally invasive application in hatcheries culturing conservation stocks. The technical approach revealed annual shifts in stress, infection, and timing of smolt readiness. Future monitoring of pathogens in hatchery source water is crucial to minimize infection potential and maximize post-release survival in stocks of conservation concern."

**Overview:**  
A proactive holistic health monitoring approach based on high throughput molecular technologies has been validated for utility in two salmon enhancement hatcheries, and is now ready for minimally invasive application in hatcheries culturing conservation stocks. The technical approach revealed annual shifts in stress, infection, and timing of smolt readiness. Future monitoring of pathogens in hatchery source water is crucial to minimize infection potential and maximize post-release survival in stocks of conservation concern.   

**Activities:**  
1.Conduct bi-monthly sampling at hatcheries from January (using last fiscal funds to March 31) through final release in June of 2025, followed by brood fish returning in 2025, and hatchlings under culture from January to March 31 2026.  Because this third year we are expanding the breadth of hatcheries and stocks for proactive health monitoring, collections will be led by the hatchery biologists, rather than the molecular team, who will be provided training and equipment in early January 2025.  Hatchery staff will collect gill clips from moribund and recently dead Chinook and filtered water samples from each rearing pond and all incoming water sources to the hatcheries.  They may also opportunistically sample water from the watershed where fish will be ultimately released.   
2. Apply custom hatchery Fit-Chip to gill tissue, and a custom pathogen chip to eRNA/DNA samples bi-weekly as samples come in (combining samples for multiple hatcheries to meet the minimum 80 samples required to run the analysis).  All collection and sample processing data will be housed in the DFO Genomics SQL database, and semi-automated reports generated and sent back to the hatcheries within two weeks after samples are received. 
3. Conduct additional hatchery monitoring, where required, when mortality events or other concerns to hatchery managers occur. 
4. Gather husbandry data from the hatcheries that will ultimately support analysis of Fit-Chip and eRNA data to identify practices that may increase incidence of stress and pathogen exposure within hatcheries.
4. Provide an annual report back on spring sampling to hatchery managers.
