## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Andrew Ross  
**Division:** Ocean Sciences (OSD)  
**Section:** Ecology and Biogeochemistry  
**Location:** ["Barkley Sound"]  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Threat Assessment and Mitigation  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  
**Speaker Theme:** Marine ecosystems and stressors  

**Overview:**  
Biotoxins produced by harmful algae are known to cause illness and mortality
in marine animals including planktivorous fish (Starr et al., 2017). Regular
monitoring of harmful algal biotoxins in BC coastal waters since 2020 has
revealed significant correlations between climate variables (e.g. water
temperature) and the concentrations of these toxins in areas known to be
frequented by Pacific salmon, including WCVI Chinook for which harmful algae
have been identified as a high future risk (PSSI Risk Assessment Workshop #3).
The goal of this project is to build upon our Biotoxin Monitoring Program (DFO
Fieldnote #24) by adapting established analytical methods and procedures to
measure harmful algal biotoxins in Pacific salmon, their prey and habitat.
This information will be combined with environmental and taxonomic (plankton)
data, and assessments of the health and condition of sampled fish, to help
predict the effects of climate change and related processes on the exposure of
Pacific salmon to these toxins, and potential impacts on their health and
survival.
