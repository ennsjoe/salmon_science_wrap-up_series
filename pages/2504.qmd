description: "Automobile tires break down and leave the toxic chemical 6PPD-quinone on roadways. Rain events wash 6PPD-quinone into salmon-bearing streams, sometimes in amounts lethal to coho salmon. This contaminant monitoring study samples water quality from 10 new sites on salmon-bearing streams in urban areas of greater Vancouver, Squamish, and Vancouver Island to detect toxic amounts and compare to stormwater green infrastructure areas."
