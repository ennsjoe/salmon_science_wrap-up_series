## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Lisa Loseto  
**Division:** Ocean Sciences (OSD)  
**Section:** Ecology and Biogeochemistry  
**Location:** ["Greater Vancouver","Squamish"]  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Threat Assessment and Mitigation  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  
**Speaker Theme:** Freshwater ecosystems and stressors  

**Overview:**  
6PPD-quinone has been found to be the cause of toxic injury and death (40-90%)
of adult coho salmon returning to urban and semi-urban waterways in Puget
Sound. Over the past year our 6PPD-quinone (6PPD-q) field program has been
working to characterize the presence of the toxic tire derived chemical 6PPD-q
at 32 sites in salmon bearing creeks in the greater Vancouver area, Squamish
and Vancouver Island before, during, and after rain events. The sample
collection has been carried out with help from World Fisheries Trust,
Peninsula Streams Society, and the Musqueam, Tsleil-Waututh, Tsawwassen, and
Cowichan First Nations. Preliminary data from the greater Vancouver area in
2022 showed significantly higher levels of 6PPD-q in creeks during rainfall
events, with levels approaching or exceeding expected effects levels and
lethality in coho salmon. The goal of the proposed project is to build on
these findings by 1) collecting water samples at 10 new priority sites in
salmon bearing creeks; 2) assessing 6PPD-quinone levels temporally before,
during, and after a rain event at a reduced number of priority sites; 3)
characterizing the removal of 6PPD-quinone from stormwater green
infrastructure. This project will deliver new data on 6PPD-quinone levels in
salmon bearing creeks in coastal British Columbia. This study will provide
enabling information to PSSI and fisheries managers as they aim to curb
historic declines in Pacific salmon, particularly coho salmon which are highly
sensitive to this chemical, and enable their recovery.
