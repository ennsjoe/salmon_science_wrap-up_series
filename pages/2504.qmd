title: "Identifying and characterizing tire-related chemical (6PPD-quinone) toxic hotspots in salmon habitat"
description: "Automobile tires break down and leave the toxic chemical 6PPD-quinone on roadways. Rain events wash 6PPD-quinone into salmon-bearing streams, sometimes in amounts lethal to coho salmon. This contaminant monitoring study samples water quality from 10 new sites on salmon-bearing streams in urban areas of greater Vancouver, Squamish, and Vancouver Island to detect toxic amounts and compare to stormwater green infrastructure areas."

**Overview:**  
Automobile tires break down and leave the toxic chemical 6PPD-quinone on roadways. Rain events wash 6PPD-quinone into salmon-bearing streams, sometimes in amounts lethal to coho salmon. This contaminant monitoring study samples water quality from 10 new sites on salmon-bearing streams in urban areas of greater Vancouver, Squamish, and Vancouver Island to detect toxic amounts and compare to stormwater green infrastructure areas.   

**Activities:**  
â€¢ Continue generating 6PPD-q data for the 6 (perhaps just 2 this final year) green infrastructure sites;
â€¢ Compare all data to laboratory exposure concentrations known to elicit toxic injury and death to salmon species;
â€¢ Complete the hotspot characterization for salmon bearing streams using our data combined with modeling exercises that will be carried out in collaboration with our partners from SFU and UBC;
â€¢ Provide enabling information to PSSI and fisheries managers pertaining to salmon exposure to this toxic tire associated chemical;
â€¢ Work with ECCC and other regulatory agencies to provide expert input on the regulation of this toxic chemical.
Complete summary data report and journal publication on results.
