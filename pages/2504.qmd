title: "Identifying and characterizing tire-related chemical (6PPD-quinone) toxic hotspots in salmon habitat"
---

## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Lisa Loseto  
**Division:** Ocean Sciences (OSD)  
**Section:** Ecology and Biogeochemistry   
**Location:** ["Greater Vancouver","Squamish"]  

**Overview:**  
Automobile tires break down and leave the toxic chemical 6PPD-quinone on roadways. Rain events wash 6PPD-quinone into salmon-bearing streams, sometimes in amounts lethal to coho salmon. This contaminant monitoring study samples water quality from 10 new sites on salmon-bearing streams in urban areas of greater Vancouver, Squamish, and Vancouver Island to detect toxic amounts and compare to stormwater green infrastructure areas.
