## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Lauren Weir  
**Division:** Stock Assessment and Research (StAR)  
**Section:** Fraser and Interior Area Salmon Stock Assessment  
**Location:** N/A  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Threat Assessment and Mitigation  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  
**Speaker Theme:** Salmon population monitoring and assessment  

**Overview:**  
Okanagan Chinook are the only remaining Columbia River Chinook Salmon
population in Canada. Their abundance is very low, currently less than a
couple hundred spawners, but their abundance was likely in the high thousands
before the Canadian Okanagan and Columbia River were developed for
Agriculture, Flood Control, and Hydro-power Generation, resulting in physical
exclusion from spawning and rearing habitats. Fishing rates have also been
high through history, with recent (2009-2018) exploitation rates around 60%.
The population in the U.S. section of the Okanagan River has recently ranged
from 7,000-14,000 spawners.

COSEWIC has identified this single river Designatable Unit as ENGANGERED, and
it is currently undergoing review for listing under the Species at Risk Act.
Additionally, this stock is part of Batch 1 for the Fish Stock Provisions
under the Fisheries Act. The DFO has considerable engagement with First
Nations, the Okanagan Water Management Board, the Okanagan River Restoration
Initiative, as well as the Colville Confederated Tribes, the Columbia River
Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife,
the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Pacific Salmon Commission.
Rebuilding the abundance of Okanagan Chinook is a priority for First Nations
and local, provincial, and national fisheries agencies on both sides of the
boarder.

Recently, the Pacific Salmon Commission conducted a series of 5 workshops with
fisheries professionals and First Nations which examined threats, impediments
to survival, and mitigation approaches to increase the abundance of Okanagan
Chinook. Similarly, a Recovery Potential Assessment (DFO Pacific Region CSAS)
and DFO Risk Assessment Methods (RAMS) have been applied and also identified
threats and mitigations. Among the issues identified in these assessments, the
key ones include Climate Change and its influence on the thermal and
hydrological regime of the Okanagan, channelization and the disconnection of
the main river channels from the historic and off-channel stream habitats, and
predation by invasive fish species. Two of the data gaps that were highlighted
from this work are the juvenile habitat use in the Okanagan, which has been
highly disturbed and degraded, and the level of predation on juvenile Chinook
salmon by native and non-native fishes. To enable rebuilding it will be
essential to have information on habitat use and to understand the threat
posed by predation. Graduate students provide the most efficient way to answer
these critical research questions. The use of graduate students will allow for
targeted and timely research while building capacity and knowledge for when
they enter the workforce.
