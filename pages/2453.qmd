title: "Epigenetic variation between hatchery- and natural-origin Canadian Chinook Salmon"
description: "There are few genetic differences between hatchery-bred and natural salmon in populations enhanced by the Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP), but structural modifications to genes may affect gene expression and impact salmon fitness in the wild. This genetic sequencing study gathers Chinook samples from hatcheries at the Nicola, Quinsam, Sarita, Atnarko, and Chilliwack rivers to compare epigenetic (methylation) differences between hatchery and wild Chinook to better monitor the proportion of hatchery salmon in a river."

**Overview:**  
There are few genetic differences between hatchery-bred and natural salmon in populations enhanced by the Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP), but structural modifications to genes may affect gene expression and impact salmon fitness in the wild. This genetic sequencing study gathers Chinook samples from hatcheries at the Nicola, Quinsam, Sarita, Atnarko, and Chilliwack rivers to compare epigenetic (methylation) differences between hatchery and wild Chinook to better monitor the proportion of hatchery salmon in a river.   

**Activities:**  
1) Complete analysis of DNA methylation difference between hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook salmon from year two of the project.
2) Collect data to confirm a lack of genetic differentiation between hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook salmon for hatcheries with epigenetic data from year one or two of the project.
3) Collect data to assess DNA methylation differences between hatchery- and natural-origin salmon across species produced from the same hatchery.
4) Assess the development of differences in DNA methylation and genetic variants associated with captive-brood hatchery production.
5) Identify candidate epigenomic biomarkers for use in high-throughput molecular tools to support monitoring and management decisions, and develop molecular tools to screen for any identified biomarkers (e.g. pyrosequencing assays, eDNA methylation sequencing assays).
