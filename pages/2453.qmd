**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Hatchery Science  
**PSSI Pillar:** 2-Salmon enhancement  

**Overview:**  
Enhancement of Pacific salmon through hatchery production is a key component
of supporting wild salmon populations. Objectives of hatchery enhancement span
conserving at-risk stocks, rebuilding lower abundance stocks, providing
harvest opportunities and increasing public awareness through outreach and
education. However, there are also risks associated with hatchery enhancement;
differences between a hatchery and a natural habitat affect both the genetic
and environmental factors that shape the performance and fitness of salmon.
Consequently, hatchery-origin salmon may be less suited to wild habitats than
their natural-origin counterparts, and the presence of hatchery-origin fish on
a natural spawning ground may reduce the fitness of a population overall.
Despite the known risks and consequences of hatchery enhancement, major
genetic differences between hatchery-origin and natural-origin salmonids as a
result of hatchery-mediated selection or relaxed selection have generally not
been observed in integrated populations. In contrast, substantial epigenetic
differences have been detected between hatchery-origin and natural-origin
Pacific salmonids. Epigenetic variants are structural changes to DNA without a
change in the DNA sequence itself. For example, DNA methylation is a commonly
studied epigenetic mechanism in which a methyl group (-CH3) is covalently
added to a cytosine residue. These modifications to DNA can alter the function
of the genome, particularly through the regulation of gene expression. Given
the extent of variation in epigenetic signatures between hatchery-origin and
natural-origin salmon, the functional effects of epigenetic variants are
excellent candidates to underlie the fitness consequences associated with
hatchery enhancement. Additionally, it is possible for hatchery epigenetic
variants to be inherited by the offspring of hatchery-origin fish, which
aligns with the potential for long-term reductions in population fitness as
hatchery-origin fish spawn in natural habitats. The study of epigenetic
variation in Pacific salmonids is relatively in its infancy, but epigenetic
biomarkers are a promising tool to facilitate managing hatchery enhancement
specifically and salmon fisheries generally. A critical knowledge gap in the
generation of these tools is that epigenetic differences between hatchery- and
natural-origin Chinook Salmon have not been well-characterized within enhanced
populations or across populations enhanced by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada
Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). Therefore, a comprehensive examination of
DNA methylation between hatchery- and natural-origin Canadian Chinook Salmon
is a high priority, which will be followed by the development of epigenetic
biomarkers and tools for monitoring and management. The first-year objectives
of the study are: 1) Identify hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook Salmon in
broodstock from five SEP hatcheries through assignments of parentage-based
tags (confirmed hatchery lines: Nicola River, Quinsam River, Sarita River,
Atnarko River Upper, Chilliwack River Fall, Chilliwack River Summer). 2)
Utilize enzymatic methyl sequencing to assess DNA methylation patterns among
female and male hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook Salmon across difference
age classes of return. 3) Determine hatchery-origin epigenetic variants that
are: common across all hatcheries studied, specific to individual hatcheries,
associated with physiological performance, associated with sex, or associated
with age of return. 4) Identify candidate epigenomic biomarkers for use in
high-throughput molecular tools to support monitoring and management
decisions. The long-term objectives of the study are: 5) Develop high-
throughput molecular tools to screen epigenetic biomarkers in Chinook Salmon
(e.g. pyrosequencing, eDNA methylation sequencing) 6) Expand the regional
coverage of hatchery lines assessed to confirm generality of hatchery-origin
variants across SEP programming. 7) Fully assess and resolve regional and
hatchery specific epigenetic differences between hatchery- and natural-origin
Chinook Salmon to support high-resolution targeted monitoring efforts. 8)
Investigate the temporal and environmental sensitivity of hatchery-origin
epigenetic variants, and the extent to which hatchery-origin epigenetic
variants occur across tissue types. 9) Examine the establishment of hatchery-
origin epigenetic variants through stages of hatchery production. 10) Assess
epigenomic patterns that could be used to indicate the age of hatchery-origin
Chinook Salmon in SEP enhancement lines.
