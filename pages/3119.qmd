## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband  
**Division:** N/A  
**Section:** Molecular Genetics  
**Location:** N/A  
**Status:** New  
**Theme:** Unspecified  
**PSSI Pillar:** Unspecified  

**Overview:**  
The objective of this project is to assess and understand the genetic
consequences of interbreeding of hatchery strays into non-native populations
of Chinook Salmon. Pacific salmon populations are known to display local
adaptation, such that native spawners are typically better suited to their
local habitat than non-native spawners. This can be exacerbated for strays
from populations that are integrated with hatchery enhancement, because
hatchery adaptation can further reduce fitness in natural environments.
Previous work on West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook Salmon has
demonstrated that strays from several major production facilities have
interbreed with natural populations in other rivers, resulting in
introgression of hatchery genetic variation and homogenization of population-
level variation. This work was conducted in the mid-2010s and utilized only
~12-15 genetic biomarkers, providing low density estimates of this
introgression. Low density estimates may mischaracterize the extent of
introgression, and cannot inform either the repeatability of introgression, or
the potential maladaptive consequences across different genomics regions. In
this project, we propose to update the estimates of introgression from
Robertson Creek and Conuma River Hatcheries among WCVI Chinook Salmon
populations, and to assess introgression with a high-density genomic
sequencing strategy to provide high resolution estimates of hatchery
introgression. The results of this work will inform advice processes regarding
management of hatchery strays and adaptive influences at levels above
individual populations (e.g., conservations units).
