## 📋 Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband  
**Division:** NA  
**Section:** Molecular Genetics  
**PSSI Pillar:** NA  
**Speaker Theme:** Genetic insights into adaptation  
**Presentation:** December 09, 2025  

**Overview:**  
NA   

**Activities:**  
1) Collaboratively with the SEP-Science genetics working group establish a highly relevant sampling strategy / sample set for analysis in the project, 2) sequence reference samples for native variation among chosen hatchery and natural populations of WCVI Chinook Salmon, 3) re-sequence a subset of representative samples from the previous work using high-density genetic markers, and 4) sequence an initial set of contemporary samples to assess genome-level hatchery introgression in WCVI Chinook populations.
