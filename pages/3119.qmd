## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband  
**Division:** N/A  
**Section:** Molecular Genetics  
**PSSI Pillar:** Unspecified  
**Speaker Theme:** Hatchery science  

**Overview:**  
No description available.
**Activities:**  
1) Collaboratively with the SEP-Science genetics working group establish a highly relevant sampling strategy / sample set for analysis in the project, 2) sequence reference samples for native variation among chosen hatchery and natural populations of WCVI Chinook Salmon, 3) re-sequence a subset of representative samples from the previous work using high-density genetic markers, and 4) sequence an initial set of contemporary samples to assess genome-level hatchery introgression in WCVI Chinook populations.
