**Overview:**  
Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a deadly virus of sockeye
salmon, causing catastrophic losses during the early lifestages (1-4). Long-
term monitoring of IHNV infections across multiple stocks of sockeye salmon
has revealed the prevalence of IHNV infections can vary annually within and
between stocks; however, the factor(s) responsible for such fluctuations in
IHNV prevalence in sockeye salmon stocks in British Columbia remain
unresolved. Understanding the drivers behind the occurrence and perpetuation
of IHNV in Sockeye salmon is instrumental in managing and mitigating the risk
of this endemic pathogen.

Building upon work conducted through the Program for Aquaculture Regulatory
Research, weâ€™ll utilize epidemiological analytical approaches to study the
patterns of IHNV occurrence across Fraser, Skeena and Columbia River Sockeye
salmon stocks with the goal of identifying the factors which influence IHNV
infection and disease in BC Sockeye salmon stocks. This will be achieved
through three main objectives accomplished over a two year period: Objective
1: (Year 1) â€“ Expand upon a long-term dataset of IHNV in Fraser and Skeena
Sockeye stocks to include IHNV monitoring results of Okanagan River Sockeye
salmon. In addition this comprehensive IHNV dataset will be populated with
data detailing the enumeration of fish at various life stages, survival rates,
and productivity for each of the corresponding Sockeye stocks. Where
available, data concerning environmental and other potentially important
variables gathered from other databases will be integrated into the new
database to explore how these variables may impact pathogen prevalence.

Objective 2: (Year 1&amp; 2) â€“ Data verification and analyses to compare IHNV
prevalence across the multiple Sockeye salmon stocks, evaluating similarities
and differences both within and between stocks along with temporal and spatial
variation.

Objective 3: (Year 2 &amp; 3) â€“ Use a mixed-effects analysis and ecosystem health
approach to determine how changes in pathogen prevalence in wild sockeye
populations relate to environmental and other potentially important factors
and management measures in an effort to identify potential correlates with
IHNV variability.

This work will permit a data-based logical argument enabling one to quantify
specific environmental or other variable affects on IHNV status and facilitate
the development and implementation of management measures to mitigate effects
of IHNV in hatchery and enhanced populations of Sockeye salmon.
