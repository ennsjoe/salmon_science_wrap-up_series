description: "Marine survival is a limiting factor for the endangered Sakinaw Lake sockeye smolts who migrate past hundreds of harbour seals at Hodgson Islands in the Strait of Georgia every spring. This salmon tracking study traps and PIT tags up to 2,500 sockeye smolts at a smolt fence, then transports the sockeye by boat past the seal colony and compares the survival rate of transported sockeye to naturally migrating smolts."

**Overview:**  
Marine survival is a limiting factor for the endangered Sakinaw Lake sockeye smolts who migrate past hundreds of harbour seals at Hodgson Islands in the Strait of Georgia every spring. This salmon tracking study traps and PIT tags up to 2,500 sockeye smolts at a smolt fence, then transports the sockeye by boat past the seal colony and compares the survival rate of transported sockeye to naturally migrating smolts.   

**Activities:**  
In year 4 (spring 2025), we propose maintaining releases of at least 2,500 tags to achieve adequate sample sizes in order to properly test the hypothesis.  Sockeye transport totals to date include 200 fish in year one (2022), 2,659 in year two and 4,845 in year three.  As the majority of fish spend two years at sea we expect the first significant tag return to occur in summer 2025, peaking in summer 2026.  It is recommended that in a budget limited situation priority is placed on optimizing PIT detection systems over additional tag deployments.  Reliability of antenna arrays was improved in 2024/25 with the installation of a fixed three panel solar system which exceeded power demands.  Additional activities may include walking the Hodson Island haul out with a mobile PIT tag antenna to look for evidence of predation on out migrating smolts (river or transport groups; Coho and Sockeye), installing a PIT antenna on the haul out, additional PIT antennas in the approaches to the river and/or hydro acoustic monitoring of night-time predation behavior in the estuary.
