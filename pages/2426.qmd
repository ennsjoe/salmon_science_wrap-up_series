**Theme:** Threat Assessment and Mitigation  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  

**Overview:**  
Sakinaw sockeye smolts out-migrate from Sakinaw Lake each spring into the
Strait of Georgia. Recovery efforts have determined that the marine survival
of this population is very low, which is a major limiting factor to population
recovery. On water surveys of pinnipeds from the estuary out to the seal haul
outs on Hodgson Islands (approximately 2km from the estuary, Figure 1) during
the spring out-migration timing (since 2019) have estimated from approximately
100-350 harbour seals in the area.

This project was started as a pilot in 2022 to test the hypothesis that the
Hodgson Island harbour seal population is negatively affecting smolt survival,
and subsequently adult returns. The goal of the project is to transport and
release smolts past the seal haul out and then compare marine survival rates
between transported smolts and those out-migrating naturally. The pilot
project began with a low number of smolts transported in small trial releases
to test the effect of additional handling/ osmoregulation on fish as well as
the function of equipment. Small numbers of fish were PIT tagged to confirm
fish are able to recover from the procedure and be transported on the same
day. Additional activities included continuation of harbour seal counts
(Figure 2) on local haul outs during the smolt (May) and adult (July) peak
migration windows. Transport activities are conducted with shÃ­shÃ¡lh Nationâ€™s
newly acquired 30 foot aluminum landing craft which is suited to this kind of
work.

In years 2-5 (spring 2023-2026), we propose scaling up releases to achieve
adequate sample sizes in order to properly test the hypothesis. A minimum of
1,000 and up to 2,500 PIT tagged sockeye are recommended per year such that a
1% survival will yield a total of 10-25 tag returns. Return rates of less than
1% may be too low to justify operationalizing this activity long term. The
transport of non-tagged fish should be avoided as to not confound comparisons
with the control group (untagged fence migrants). Results from 2023/24
releases will be realized in 2025/26 escapement years at which point a
decision on the future of the project can be made. Additional activities may
include walking the Hodson Island haul out with a mobile PIT tag antenna to
look for evidence of predation on out migrating smolts (river or transport
groups; Coho and Sockeye), or installing a PIT antenna on the haul out.

Sakinaw Sockeye has been confirmed as an endangered stock since 2003, and a
recovery potential assessment, completed in 2017 cited low marine survival as
the greatest limiting factor in recovery, with predator abundance and assumed
predation on smolts and adults ranked as high risk, with a critical level of
impact. Perpetually low marine survivals are preventing recovery such that the
persistence of the population is entirely dependent on a captive brood
program. This activity may be one of the few tools available to increase
survival.
