## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Eric Rondeau, Tim Healy, Kyle Wellband  
**Division:** Aquatic Diagnostics, Genomics and Technology (ADGT)  
**Section:** Molecular Genetics  
**Location:** ["Fraser","Chilliwack River"]  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Innovation & Diagnostics  
**PSSI Pillar:** 2-Salmon enhancement  

**Overview:**  
The objective of this study is to better understand the population structure
of Chum salmon in British Columbia, to help strengthen genetic stock
delineation.

In the initial phases of the project, the focus will begin on the southern
coastal populations. While stock delineation using the existing SNP panel is
close to Conservation Unit-level resolution, there remain difficult
delineations to make that are of interest to stock assessment and management.
For year 1, the focus will be predominately on the lower Fraser, where
delineation of Chilliwack River from the remaining lower Fraser populations
remains difficult in the current analysis methods but is desired to support
management objectives. To better understand what differentiates these
populations, we will use next generation sequencing technologies to perform
low-coverage whole genome sequencing on a selection of spawning populations in
the lower Fraser, Chilliwack River, and select populations in the Salish sea
in the first year - this will include enhanced stocks from each region. Future
analyses will identify where differences stocks exist and allow for the
selection of genetic markers to better delineate among them, thereby allowing
for more accurate assessment and enhancement methods using genetic techniques.

This initial effort will be built upon in future years by extending sampling
to additional regions where further stock delineation is necessitated to meet
assessment and enhancement objectives, such as Strait of Georgia/Howe Sound,
West Coast Vancouver Island, and Johnstone Strait and the Central Coast.
