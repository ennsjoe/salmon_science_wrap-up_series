## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Josie Iacarella  
**Division:** Ecosystem Sciences (ESD)  
**Section:** Freshwater Ecosystems  
**Location:**   

**Overview:**  
Identifying individual and cumulative threats to salmon and their habitat is critical for effective management and restoration actions. This project estimates and maps nine human activities and landscape disturbance-based threats and four climate change-based threats for the stream network in the Fraser Basin. Results identify threat levels across salmon Conservation Units and the human activities and land uses that contributed most to threats.
