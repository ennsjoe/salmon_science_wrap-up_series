title: "Development of geospatial tools for large-scale freshwater salmon habitat assessment by the Freshwater Spatial Ecology Program"
description: "Identifying individual and cumulative threats to salmon and their habitat is critical for effective management and restoration actions. This project estimates and maps nine human activities and landscape disturbance-based threats and four climate change-based threats for the stream network in the Fraser Basin. Results identify threat levels across salmon Conservation Units and the human activities and land uses that contributed most to threats."
