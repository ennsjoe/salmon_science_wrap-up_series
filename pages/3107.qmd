**Division:** N/A  
**Section:** Regional Ecosystems Effects on Fish and Fisheries  
**Location:** N/A  
**Status:** New  
**Theme:** Unspecified  
**PSSI Pillar:** Unspecified  

**Overview:**  
The problem: Climate change is creating a more volatile, uncertain, complex,
and ambiguous world. How do hatchery managers move forward despite these
uncertainties and overcome ‚Äúmanagement paralysis‚Äù in the context of climate
change?

What is being proposed: We will use scenario planning to develop insight into
how SEP/DFO can better ensure that hatchery planning and implementation is
adaptable to climate change impacts over the next 20 years. Year 1 will focus
on a DFO internal process and plan for broader engagement in Year 2 with
Indigenous knowledge experts.

Scenario planning enables organizations to embrace uncertainty by expanding
their understanding of the plausible range of futures they may experience.
Scenarios are meant to guide and inform organizations about potential future
changes that will impact how they operate. These processes enable
organizations to be better positioned to deal with unexpected threats, and
take advantage of unexpected opportunities.

Scenario planning is a structured approach for defining plausible futures.
This is a co-learning participatory process, that has been identified as a key
way to advance climate adaptation within organizations and processes (Hare
2020). Expertise provided by DFO Science, SEP, Indigenous groups, and other
Sectors will be integrated through this process.

Scenario planning identifies areas of high impact and low predictability
within a system, and imagines future situations, termed scenarios, that could
occur given the uncertainties identified. Large-scale driving forces that may
push the future in different directions are identified and used to uncover
potential future states. Scenarios provide a fresh perspective, and a new
framework that can be used to encourage dialogue and strategic thinking on the
challenges and opportunities we may face. It is a powerful tool for forcing us
to challenge commonly-held assumptions and expectations, and abandon
previously fixed ideas that may no longer hold true. Scenarios help by
legitimizing a dialogue, challenging conventional wisdom, initiating
widespread discussion, and creating the possibility of genuine transformation.

Participants in scenario planning processes identify and evaluate management
options or adaptations that are robust to alternate plausible future
scenarios. In this way, scenario planning can help managers understand where
management strategies may need to change to prepare for the future. This work
can also prioritize knowledge gaps and future science priorities.

Scenario planning is a flexible process that can be tailored to the specific
project goals and objectives. Generally, processes follow five steps described
by Frens and Morrison (2020): 1\. Orientation to the problem: define the
specific issue being discussed, goals, scope, and desired outcomes. 2\.
Exploration: improve understanding of the issue, identify key drivers and
uncertainties. 3\. Scenario building: identify critical uncertainties
(drivers) for the scenario framework, develop plausible scenario narratives.
4\. Application: examine scenarios for implications, develop and evaluate
management actions. 5\. Identify indicators: specifically, environmental
indicators and thresholds that would trigger recommended management
strategies.

Collaboration with another ESD-SEP PSSI Proposal: this work links with ESD
proposal led by Chrys Neville: ‚ÄúAssessing the impact of modifications to
hatchery release strategies of Chinook salmon on their distribution and marine
survival‚Äô though engaging scientific expertise and knowledge that can support
scenario planning process to identify hatchery adaptation robust to future
climate change scenarios.
