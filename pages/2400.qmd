## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Amy Long  
**Division:** Aquatic Diagnostics, Genomics and Technology (ADGT)  
**Section:** Aquatic Animal Health  
**Location:** ["Spius Creek","Puntledge River","Nitinat"]  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Fish Health  
**PSSI Pillar:** 2-Salmon enhancement  

**Overview:**  
Renibacterium salmoninarum, the causative agent of bacterial kidney disease
(BKD), is endemic to the Pacific Northwest. Infection with this bacterial
pathogen can result in significant morbidity and mortality in cultured
juvenile Pacific salmon most notably Chinook salmon. The current strategy for
disease avoidance is screening brood stock to exclude eggs from highly
infected brood females using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with
a predetermined positive-negative threshold optical density value. The current
guidelines for control of BKD have significantly reduced the incidence of
disease in both hatchery-reared juveniles and returning adult fish.

The Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP) has 16 years of ELISA data for many
Vancouver Island and mainland Coho and Chinook stocks, providing thirteen
3-year cycle for Chinook and fourteen 3-year cycle for Coho salmon. In
addition, SEP also has direct fluorescent antibody technique (DFAT) semi-
quantitative prevalence pre-release data for many of the stocks with ELISA
broodstock data. Epidemiological analysis of this data will provide valuable
information for identification of potential explanatory variables for BKD
prevalence in stocks of concern. Furthermore, the ELISA database can be linked
to the Parental Based Tagging (PBT) database.

The objectives of this project are as follows: \- Analysis of the ELISA data
to identify potential explanatory variables and magnitude of effect as
hatchery level management measures. \- Use simulation to model effect of
increasing the positive-negative culling threshold optical density value \-
Analysis of the DFAT prevalence for yearling stocks prior to release to
identify potential predictor variables. \- Link PBT data with ELISA data
analysis from the first objective.
