**Speaker Theme:** Hatchery science  

**Overview:**  
The objective of this work is to determine which hatchery environmental
factors have the greatest potential to explain DNA methylation differences
between hatchery and natural origin salmon. We will accomplish this by
experimentally manipulating rearing conditions at PSEC to link aspects of
hatchery rearing environments with epigenetic patterns and assess downstream
functional consequences (gene expression). Specifically, we have reared Coho
Salmon in contrasting environmental conditions in the lab trying to isolate
various factors that differ between hatchery and natural environments. The
three treatment factors are water source (well vs. untreated creek water),
feed (standard aquaculture pellets vs. simulated natural food (mysis and
bloodworms)), and tank environment (unenriched tanks vs. semi-natural stream
tanks with gravel substrate and vegetation). All possible combinations of
factors are represented. We will conduct whole epigenome sequencing of samples
collected from all treatment groups to identify which experimental factors
have the greatest influence on DNA methylation. We will compare the specific
regions that are differentially methylated among our experimental treatments
with differences observed between hatchery and natural origin fish. The
research will provide information on which aspects of hatchery environments
may be most effective to manipulate to reduce divergence between hatchery and
natural origin fish.
