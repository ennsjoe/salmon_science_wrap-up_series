## ðŸ“‹ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Stephen Page, Richard Thomson  
**Division:** Ocean Sciences (OSD)  
**Section:** State of the Ocean

**Hosts:** NA  

**Overview:**  
NA   

**Activities:**  
1.	Update salmon data from Pacific Salmon Commission
2.	Update observed and modelled daily mean data, including new ocean model data described above.
3.	Determine significant linear correlations between salmon data and each ocean variable over previous years over various temporal lags and averaging times and space.
4.	Generate 2- and 3-variable multiple linear regression forecast models to generate a single forecast and its uncertainty (standard deviation).
