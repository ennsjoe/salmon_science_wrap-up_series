## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Ian Forster, Cher LaCoste  
**Division:** Ecosystem Sciences (ESD)  
**Section:** Nearshore Ecosystems  
**Location:** N/A  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Hatchery Science  
**PSSI Pillar:** 2-Salmon enhancement  
**Speaker Theme:** Hatchery science  

**Overview:**  
To date, much of the recent research on salmonid diets and formulation of
nutritionally complete commercial feeds has focused on rainbow trout and
Atlantic salmon (NRC 2011, Hardy and Kaushik 2021). These feeds are not
formulated for Pacific salmon, which require a specific balance of nutrients
and other diet constituents to assure egg and juvenile quality, parr-smolt
transformation and subsequent performance in seawater (Hanson et al. 2016,
Perry et al. 2006, Jutfelt et al. 2007), as well as to limit the stress
response following seawater introduction (Herrera et al. 2019). To this end,
we propose to formulate and test new diets specific for the production of
Pacific salmon, especially Chinook and coho, optimized to SEP hatcheries.

The data collected in Year 1 will help us to select diets for use in feeding
trials to be conducted at SEP facilities rearing Coho and Chinook salmon in
Years 2 and 3. Collectively, these data will support the future formulation of
improved diets for Pacific salmon.

Feeding trials will be conducted at SEP hatcheries in Years 2 and 3 on
juvenile ocean-type Chinook and Coho salmon. The diets to be compared will be
selected based upon the results of Year 1 and agreed upon by the research team
and SEP staff. Dr. Forster, the project lead, has extensive experience in
conducting and peer-review publishing comparative feeding trials in salmon.
Other team members have extensive experience in the assessment of
physiological, immunological and health status of salmon.

Ultimately, this project will provide science-based advice to SEP facilities
on the use of supplemented or specially formulated diets to better meet the
needs of Pacific salmon and specifically address management concerns as to
whether current industry-formulated feeds administered to juvenile ocean-type
Chinook and Coho are sufficiently optimized.
