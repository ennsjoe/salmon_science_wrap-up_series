**Overview:**  
The Pacific Salmon Status Scanner (the Scanner) is a decision support tool
that centralizes salmon data so users can explore their science and management
questions by interacting with data through visualizations. Through the
Scanner, salmon experts can track trends in salmon statuses, identify and
prioritize threats for mitigation, prioritize research, and monitor
effectiveness of recovery actions across five species of Pacific salmon. The
proposed project will support the transition to the CDOS supported data
lakehouse environment and expand data sets in the Scanner to other Areas and
species (existing data sets include Fraser-BCI; Southern BC Chinook &amp; Skeena-
Nass SK). This requires on-going support from two key contractors who are
experts on the Scanner code and data treatment and processing.

The past year we have developed a process map for the Scanner and its use-
cases with Eric Quan&#39;s PSSI Secretariate IT and data group. Over this upcoming
fiscal year we will be supporting the transition from Shiny-IO a paid platform
external to DFO, to Data Lakehouse environment within DFO, in terms of
warehousing the Scanner data and data visualization. This will require
engagement with existing contractors, the SOS team and support from various
DFO Science, CDOS, and Eric Quan&#39;s group.
