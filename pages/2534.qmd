## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Jennifer Jackson  
**Division:** Ocean Sciences (OSD)  
**Section:** Ecology and Biogeochemistry  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  
**Speaker Theme:** Marine ecosystems and stressors  

**Overview:**  
Arctic air masses move from the interior to coastal inlets, cooling and adding oxygen to the marine habitat. Fjords where this cooling occurs can become a marine refuge for salmon. This project monitors climate conditions in BC mainland fjords to measure the impact on salmon habitat and study how these factors may impact other coastal inlets.
**Activities:**  
1. Continue literature review
2. Continue data mining
3. Start preparation of first manuscript to identify which BC inlets are most impacted by Arctic outflow winds
