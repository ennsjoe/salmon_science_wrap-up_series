description: "Arctic air masses move from the interior to coastal inlets, cooling and adding oxygen to the marine habitat. Fjords where this cooling occurs can become a marine refuge for salmon. This project monitors climate conditions in BC mainland fjords to measure the impact on salmon habitat and study how these factors may impact other coastal inlets."
