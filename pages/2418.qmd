**Overview:**  
What is being proposed: Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency complex (TDC) is an
emerging issue of concern for Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, in the
North Pacific. Thiamine is an essential vitamin for all organisms, that is
derived from their diet. Deficiency is most overtly expressed in salmonids as
early mortality of fry, but secondary effects impact all life stages. TDC was
first observed in the North Pacific in 2014 when up to 70% of Chinook from the
Yukon River, a system which has experienced declines in Chinook productivity,
were found to have limiting levels of egg thiamine (Larson and Howard 2019;
Honeyfield et al. 2016). In 2020, TDC was diagnosed for the first time in
California Chinook and found responsible for excessive fry mortality. Despite
its presence both north and south of BC, to date, only a single study has
measured thiamine levels in BC salmon and this included just two Chinook
(Welch et al. 2018). TDC may already be an important driver of BC Chinook
salmon population declines, and is expected to be an increasingly important
issue as oceans warm and prey communities change. Significantly, when TDC is
diagnosed there are effective treatment strategies to mitigate the effects
which can be applied in hatcheries to limit fry mortality. Assessment and
monitoring, of Thiamine deficiency can be used by SEP and StAD to inform
planning decisions for stocks where expectations of reduced spawning
performance may be expected, e.g., SEP could use this information to focus egg
collection efforts, or remediation actions such as Thiamine injection / baths,
on stocks that may be at greater risk of low spawning success. StAD could use
this information to improve their assessment of the current status and health
of salmon stocks.
