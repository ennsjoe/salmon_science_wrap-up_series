title: "Barkley Sound and Clayoquot Sound acoustic monitoring of salmon and salmon prey"
---

## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Stephane Gauthier  
**Division:** Ocean Sciences (OSD)  
**Section:** Ecology and Biogeochemistry  
**Location:** ["Barkley Sound","Clayoquot Sound"]  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Ecosystem Monitoring  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  

**Overview:**  
We will use a suite of acoustic tools to improve our understanding of salmon
ecology in marine ecosystems, and drivers of marine survival. This include the
deployment of autonomous multi-frequency echosounders at strategic locations
in Barkley and Clayoquot Sounds to obtain high-resolution (continuous)
temporal and vertical data on salmon and salmon prey. The acoustic data can
provide critical information on an array of key ecosystem components,
including: a) zooplankton and euphausiids, b) juvenile salmon surface-oriented
shoals, c) small coastal pelagic forage species (e.g., schools of Pacific
herring), as well as d) large (adult) salmon. Adult Chinook salmon, because of
their conspicuous size, have a unique acoustic signature. Locations of the
instruments will be carefully selected to complement and build on current and
projected sampling efforts in the Sounds. We plan to deploy two instruments
within Barkley Sound and two within Clayoquot Sound. We also propose
conducting mobile surveys with portable echosounders and imaging sonar to
complement the mooring data. This project also leverage a number of surveys
off WCVI that have (and continue) to collect acoustic data (e.g. coast-wide
Pacific hake survey [Gauthier], Integrated Pelagic Ecosystem survey [King and
Boldt], juvenile salmon survey [King]) and will build time-series of
euphausiid and forage fish distribution, as well as adult Chinook salmon
detections along the coast.
