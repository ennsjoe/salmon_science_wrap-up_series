**Overview:**  
No description available.   

**Activities:**  
Priority 1: Broodstock PBT database: Routine access to PBT results is a known barrier for SEP staff. This project component will develop methods for enabling SEP to access them in a timely manner and suitable format. 
Deliverables:
1)	Process map showing the PBT results needed by SEP staff, current blockers to access and what their needs are for ongoing/routine access
2)	Develop proof of concept PBT data results pipeline and portal in collaboration with MGL (in EPro, data lakehouse, github or other)

Priority 2:  PNI Calculation Pipeline: Building on the understanding of PBT data processes, this component will map the various systems and data sources used to calculate PNI, then propose a standardized decision-tree system using multiple data sources and based on SEP PNI calculation guidelines. 
Deliverables:
1)	Compile SEP knowledge on PNI calculation steps
2)	Map the blockers and opportunities for formalizing these steps in a data pipeline
3)	Implement a proof of concept PNI calculation pipeline in DFOâ€™s cloud environment.
