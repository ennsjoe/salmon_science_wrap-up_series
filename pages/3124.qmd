**Overview:**  
Determining the hatchery contribution to fisheries catch and escapement is
crucial to determine the Proportionate Natural Influence (PNI) of a stock.
Used to support planning of hatchery activities, allocation of fishing effort
and research on stock composition, PNI is calculated by combining a number of
potential data sources including genetics, coded wire tags, thermal otolith
marks or fin clip recoveries, depending on the availability of data for
different stocks. Rapid calculation of PNI is currently confounded by a number
of factors including lack of managed data sources, varied analysis processes,
and disconnects between fisheries, escapement and hatchery data sources. This
project will identify the main barriers to determining PNI, develop a proof of
concept data pipeline and highlight where effort at building data management
and analysis pipelines will provide greatest benefit. The work will center on
two priority areas: Priority 1: Broodstock PBT database: Routine access to PBT
results is a known barrier for SEP staff. This project component will develop
methods for enabling SEP to access them in a timely manner and suitable
format. Deliverables: 1) Process map showing the PBT results needed by SEP
staff, current blockers to access and what their needs are for ongoing/routine
access 2) Develop proof of concept PBT data results pipeline and portal in
collaboration with MGL (in EPro, data lakehouse, github or other) Priority 2:
PNI Calculation Pipeline: Building on the understanding of PBT data processes,
this component will map the various systems and data sources used to calculate
PNI, then propose a standardized decision-tree system using multiple data
sources and based on SEP PNI calculation guidelines. Deliverables: 1) Compile
SEP knowledge on PNI calculation steps 2) Map the blockers and opportunities
for formalizing these steps in a data pipeline 3) Implement a proof of concept
PNI calculation pipeline in DFOâ€™s cloud environment.
