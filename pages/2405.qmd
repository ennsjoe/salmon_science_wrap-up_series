**Overview:**  
There is widespread recognition that Pacific salmon populations will be
heavily impacted by climate change. These impacts are, however, expected to
vary in space and time as well as across species and life stages. As a result,
quantifying stock-specific risks of environmental change is critical for
prioritizing DFO management actions. We propose to develop a data-driven
analytical framework to quantify functional responses to climate variables
across the salmon life cycle and make projections for how stocks will respond
to climate change. Our approach will be sufficiently flexible to incorporate
information from stocks that span a broad range of data quality.

Our multi-year proposal involves two components: In component 1, we will pair
existing data on Pacific salmon population dynamics with readily available
freshwater and marine environmental data to estimate the effect of variables
such as temperature, flow, and food availability on salmon productivity (e.g.
recruits per spawner). We will quantify life stage-specific effects on
survival for stocks, including those with estimates of both juvenile and adult
abundance. The focal stocks for initial modeling of data-rich stocks will be
determined in year 1, with the goal of including stocks representing different
species, geographic areas and status assessments relative to Wild Salmon
Policy benchmarks. Ultimately, we will develop a hierarchical modeling
framework which will allow us to leverage relationships in data-rich systems
to estimate effects on data-limited stocks. In component 2, we will couple
this modelling framework with downscaled climate models to project stock-
specific responses under future climate scenarios. The projected biological
status of different stocks, and associated uncertainty in them, will provide a
scientifically defensible foundation upon which management interventions can
be prioritized.

We are requesting funds to hire two term Research Scientists to develop the
modelling framework. We expect that if only one RES were funded (or one RES
and a BI2) that they could develop an initial model and demonstrate its
application to a small number of case studies. However, to achieve the goal of
developing a data-driven framework that is ready to be applied to stocks
throughout the Pacific region, including those with medium or low data
availability, two RES positions are necessary. Although the two researchers
would work collaboratively, one position is focused on fitting models to
estimate functional relationships for data-rich stock while the other will use
simulations to develop methods for leveraging information from data-rich
stocks to data-poor and provide decision criteria for broader implementation.
