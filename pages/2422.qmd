## üß¨ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Andrew Ross, Xiangjun Liao, Nicole LaForge  
**Division:** Ocean Sciences (OSD)  
**Section:** Ecology and Biogeochemistry  
**Location:** ["IOS Sidney"]  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Innovation & Diagnostics  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  

**Overview:**  
This project addresses the (IOS Mass Spectrometry) lab-based component of the
otolith microchemistry work that forms a key part of the ‚ÄúFollow the Fish‚Äù
program (FtF), the subject of a broader PSSI project proposal focused on West
Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook salmon. The overall aim of the work
described here is to develop in-house capacity for laser ablation-inductively
coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). This will provide specialized
analytical support for FtF and capacity to conduct similar analyses for other
DFO programs and activities like fish aging and ongoing projects in the Fraser
and Cowichan rivers.
