## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Shelee Hamilton  
**Division:** Stock Assessment and Research (StAR)  
**Section:** Fishery and Assessment Data  
**Location:** N/A  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Data Management  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  

**Overview:**  
Vision: All DFO-owned data relating to pacific salmon are appropriately
managed through their life cycle, made accessible internally and externally as
data assets and are regularly used to generate additional research,
operational and outreach products.  
Strategy: In the current business of Salmon research and management, data are
treated as a by-product of a decision or research process. Our strategy
focuses on building the value of data created in DFO by reducing the burden of
managing those data through its life cycle, improving the accessibility and
interoperability of those data, and increasing the opportunity for existing
data to add value in new contexts. Easier to complete/share data requests,
easier to maintain/find data.
