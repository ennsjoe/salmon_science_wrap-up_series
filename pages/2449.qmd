title: "A decision-support tool that considers harvest, hatchery, and habitat management levers to support implementation of the Fisheries Act for Pacific salmon"

## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Carrie Holt, Brendan Connors, Catarina Wor  
**Division:** Stock Assessment and Research (StAR)  
**Section:** Quantitative Assessment Methods  
**Location:** N/A  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Decision Support  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  
**Speaker Theme:** Modelling and decision support  

**Overview:**  
Our goal is to develop a salmon-specific, open-source, flexible decision-
support tool for use in integrated planning and development of rebuilding
plans under the Fish Stocks provisions (FSPs) of the Fisheries Act. The tool
will be used to address strategic questions about prioritizing management
actions. Previously used tools either do not consider uncertainty or risk
(e.g., â€˜All-H-Analyzerâ€™, AHA) or do not consider hatchery or habitat impacts
explicitly (e.g., samSim, those used in Recovery Potential Assessments, RPAs).
Importantly, the AHA tool is implemented deterministically and does not
account for uncertainty in population dynamics or associated risk to
management and therefore does not conform to DFOâ€™s Precautionary Approach
Framework. The proposed tool will fill a critical gap in DFOâ€™s ability to
strategically evaluate decisions on all three management levers, and can act
as flagship for the implementation of a Management Procedure Framework1 in the
future. This tool does not currently exist among those available to DFO for
Pacific salmon.
