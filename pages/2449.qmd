title: "A decision-support tool that considers harvest, hatchery, and habitat management levers to support implementation of the Fisheries Act for Pacific salmon"
description: "Resource managers rely on decision modelling tool and programs to predict the outcomes from different actions. For salmon management, often these tools fail to include hatchery or habitat parameters. This decision-support project develops an open source, single-population prototype model that can be applied to West Coast Vancouver Island Chinook as a case study, including hatchery and habitat levers, as well as, uncertainty and risk."

## ðŸ“‹ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Carrie Holt, Brendan Connors, Catarina Wor  
**Division:** Stock Assessment and Research (StAR)  
**Section:** Quantitative Assessment Methods  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  
**Session:** Data and modelling to support decision making  
**Presentation Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Speakers:** Carrie Holt, Brendan Connors, Catarina Wor  
**Hosts:** Ann-Marie Huang; Carrie Holt;  

**Overview:**  
Resource managers rely on decision modelling tool and programs to predict the outcomes from different actions. For salmon management, often these tools fail to include hatchery or habitat parameters. This decision-support project develops an open source, single-population prototype model that can be applied to West Coast Vancouver Island Chinook as a case study, including hatchery and habitat levers, as well as, uncertainty and risk.   

**Activities:**  
The outcome of Y3 will be the refinement and finalization of the decision-support tool for this case study on WCVI Chinook, tailored to client needs. This will result in a summary document outlining guidelines for the use of the decision-support tool for Pacific Salmon management when accounting for harvest, hatchery and habitat as potential management levers.
