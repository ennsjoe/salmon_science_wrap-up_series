title: "Measurement of stress hormones in scales and its application for the identification of conditions causing chronic stress in Pacific Salmon."
description: "Chronic stress impacts fish health and can be measured in salmon by sampling hormone (cortisol) and enzyme deposits in scales. This lab and hatchery study gathers coho and Chinook scale samples from broodstock surveys to develop methods of measuring chronic and acute stress hormone levels that could be expanded to monitor salmon health responses to stressors including climate change."

**Overview:**  
Chronic stress impacts fish health and can be measured in salmon by sampling hormone (cortisol) and enzyme deposits in scales. This lab and hatchery study gathers coho and Chinook scale samples from broodstock surveys to develop methods of measuring chronic and acute stress hormone levels that could be expanded to monitor salmon health responses to stressors including climate change.   

**Activities:**  
Year 3:  Completion of sample analysis, statistical analysis and reporting of results through presentations and publication in peer-reviewed journals.
