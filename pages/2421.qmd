**Overview:**  
Exposure of fish to stressors can elicit physiological changes at multiple
levels of animal organization, these alterations are collectively known as the
stress response. The hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis which is
activated in response to most forms of stress in fish, initiates and regulates
the stress response. In fish cortisol is the predominant glucocorticoid
released as part of the primary stress response, and is critical for mediating
adaptive metabolic, physiological, and behavioral adjustments. However,
prolonged elevation of cortisol, due to extended or repeated exposure to
stressors, can negatively affect fish behavior, growth, reproduction and
immune functions (reviewed in Schreck and Tort, 2016).

The analysis of circulating (serum/plasma) cortisol is the most common method
used in stress response assessments in fish. This method works well under
controlled situations, where fish can be caught and rapidly sampled (within
minutes to avoid the rapid increase in cortisol which occurs in response to
capture stress) and it provides information on the acute stress response at
the time of collection (immediate state of stress). However, to understand
chronic stress the past cortisol history of individuals needs to be
understood. Fish scales have been recently recognized as a biomaterial that
accumulates cortisol, and other physiologically important hormones including
cortisone, over long periods of time. Moreover, scale cortisol levels are not
affected by stress associated with capture (reviewed in Laberge et al. 2019;
Kennedy and Janz, 2023).

Cortisol is released from the interrenals in fish as a biologically active
steroid hormone. At the tissue level, the enzyme 11Î²-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase type 2 (11Î²hsd2) converts cortisol into its biologically
inactive metabolite, cortisone. Importantly, this step is irreversible in
fish, highlighting the importance of 11Î²hsd2 in the regulation of cortisol
levels in teleosts (Tsachaki et al. 2017). Since 11Î²hsd2 is present in fish
skin, assessing the expression of this enzyme in the skin during chronic
stress, and measuring both cortisol and cortisone content will provide
critical context for scale cortisol deposition and clearance, and further
validate the use of scales as an indicator of chronic stress in fish.

We are proposing the use of levels of stress hormones (cortisol, cortisone) in
scales as a tool for routine monitoring of chronic stress in different life
history stages of Pacific salmon. As an example, this tool could be used to
examine individual and population effects of external stressors encountered
during migration on cortisol dynamics, which has implications with respect to
population resilience to stressors such as climate change. The use of scales
is minimally invasive and therefore suitable for use in populations of
conservation concern. However, to interpret values obtained from scales we
first need to understand the temporal profile of stress hormone accumulation
and rates of clearance in scales under different environmental conditions for
the different species of Pacific Salmon.

In this project we will conduct laboratory and hatchery-based studies to
determine/optimize: 1) sampling methods (e.g. study spatial heterogeneity of
scale stress hormone content (SSHC)), 2) effects of acute vs. chronic stress
on SSHC, 3) relationship between plasma and SSHC, 4) individual, stock and
temporal variability in SSHC, including changes associated with
smoltification, and 5) effects of unpredictable chronic stress on plasma and
SSHC. We will use, and modify, if necessary, analytical methods for SSHC that
have been used in studies of goldfish and rainbow trout (Laberge et al. 2019;
Kennedy and Janz, 2023).
