## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Jennifer Jackson  
**Location:** N/A  
**Status:** Ongoing  

**Overview:**  
Continuous marine salmon habitat measurements are important for fisheries management. The BC Shore Station Program collects long-term sea surface temperature and salinity at twelve coastal stations, but the data are coarse and limited by weather and labour. This ecosystem monitoring project is testing and installing a minimum of four independent water quality logging stations spanning the coast to collect and transmit hourly real-time data posted online.
