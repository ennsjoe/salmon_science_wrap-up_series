title: "Complementing British Columbiaâ€™s coasts longest Sea Surface Temperature and Salinity records with 21st century technology to monitor a changing climate."
description: "Continuous marine salmon habitat measurements are important for fisheries management. The BC Shore Station Program collects long-term sea surface temperature and salinity at twelve coastal stations, but the data are coarse and limited by weather and labour. This ecosystem monitoring project is testing and installing a minimum of four independent water quality logging stations spanning the coast to collect and transmit hourly real-time data posted online."

**Overview:**  
Continuous marine salmon habitat measurements are important for fisheries management. The BC Shore Station Program collects long-term sea surface temperature and salinity at twelve coastal stations, but the data are coarse and limited by weather and labour. This ecosystem monitoring project is testing and installing a minimum of four independent water quality logging stations spanning the coast to collect and transmit hourly real-time data posted online.   

**Activities:**  
Year 3: final deployment of up to 4 sites; cost = $30,000 /site + $15,000 spares
Outcomes: real-time acquisition of high-resolution SST & SSS at key site(s) with an enhanced, coast-wide, view of BCâ€™s nearshore climate and variability.
