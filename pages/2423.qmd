## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Jennifer Jackson  
**Division:** Ocean Sciences (OSD)  
**Section:** State of the Ocean  
**Location:** N/A  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Innovation & Diagnostics  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  

**Overview:**  
At present, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data
are collected as part of DFOâ€™s British Columbia Shore Station Program (BCSOP)
at twelve coastal stations that have been monitored for several decades, the
earliest commencing in 1914 (see map below).

The data are collected manually, by lighthouses keepers, at a daily interval.
Despite its success in providing data at remote locations for an outstanding
duration (one of the longest in the world of this kind), the program faces
challenges and limitations: gaps due to weather conditions, concerns with
lighthouse keepers payment, time lag between data collection and reception and
relatively coarse observational resolution. Theses challenges result in gaps
in the timeseries which can limit their otherwise wide range of possible
applications.

To address those challenges and enhance these valuable timeseries, we propose
the testing and deployment of autonomous systems which can record SST and SSS
at higher frequency (e.g. hourly) and transmit those data in near real-time.
The system would consist of an in-situ sensors package, a data logger and
transmitter and an antenna. Examples of such systems include elements of the
Ocean Network Canada (https://data.oceannetworks.ca/home) and of Smart
Atlantic, on the East coast
(https://www.smartatlantic.ca/station_alt.html?id=dfo_nharb).

The main outcome of this project will be the acquisitions of continuous, gap-
free, high resolution (hourly) timeseries of SST and SSS at key sites along
the BC coast. These timeseries would be available in real-time mode and/or
delay mode and posted online via the Open Data portal
(https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/719955f2-bf8e-44f7-bc26-6bd623e82884)
as well as on the Ocean Network Canada and Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing
System (CIOOS, https://cioos.ca/about/). The number of sites to be equipped
upon successful testing (1st year) will depend on budget available (details
below); a minimum of 4 stations would be necessary to be representative of the
BC coast as a whole, i.e. Salish Sea (Chrome Island to Race Rocks), West coast
(Amphitrite Point to Kains Island), North coast (Pine Island to Bonilla
Island) and Haida Gwaii (Langara Island). Region and station priorities would
be defined upon results of the first year tests and in coordination with other
researchers and PSSI priorities.

SST and SSS characteristics determine the suitability of marine ecosystems
habitat for native and invasive species that impacts migration patterns,
predator-prey relationships and stock abundance. Data from the BCSOP currently
contributes to fisheries management as input into forecasts of the northern
diversion of Fraser River sockeye and models of salmon and anchovy stock
abundance in the Strait of Georgia. Thus, enhanced data from this initiative
would not only strengthen the current applications but also be helpful to
newly implemented PSSI initiatives.
