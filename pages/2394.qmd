**Overview:**  
The Pacific Region groundfish trawl fishery likely represents the largest
source of Pacific salmon catch in a non-salmon directed commercial fishery.
While all Pacific salmon species are prohibited in groundfish trawl and cannot
be sold or traded, salmon bycatch in trawl fisheries experience high mortality
rates and there have been no management measures in place to monitor or
mitigate risks to stocks of concern. This sampling program was designed in
collaboration between DFO Science, Fisheries Management, industry and
monitoring service providers to provide accurate estimates of salmon bycatch
by species in the trawl fishery and representative information on Chinook
stock composition and indicator stocks.

Initial discussions led to the following four objectives being adopted to
guide development of the program: 1\. Accurately estimate the catch in numbers
of fish of each salmon species; 2\. Ensure sufficiently accurate and
representative CWT sampling to quantify the fishery mortality for Chinook
indicator stocks; 3\. Use genetic stock identification (i.e. DNA) where
feasible to identify the stock composition of Chinook catch, including for
populations that do not have CWT indicator stocks; and 4\. Estimate the
spatial and temporal distribution of Chinook catch to determine when and where
exploitation on stocks of concern may be occurring.

The program was initiated across for all option A groundfish trawl vessels in
September 2022, and will be continued during the 2023/24 fiscal year.
