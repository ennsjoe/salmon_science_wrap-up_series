**Activities:**  
2024, Jan-March: Purchase materials and supplies for diatom growout and salinity trials.

2024 - 2025: Purchase materials and supplies for diatom growout and salinity trials if not completed in January - March, 2024. Determine effect of salinity on diatom production and the generation of LC-PUFAs. These effects will be determined at lag growth phase (initial), exponential phase (maximum growth), and stationary phase (decline). Acquire chemicals and supplies for analyses.

2025 - 2026: Generate manuscript and submit to Journal. Develop plain-language report.
