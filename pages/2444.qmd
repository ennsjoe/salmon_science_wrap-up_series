## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Lauren Weir  
**Division:** Stock Assessment and Research (StAR)  
**Section:** Fraser and Interior Area Salmon Stock Assessment  
**Location:** ["Thompson","Nicola River"]  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Salmon Monitoring  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  

**Overview:**  
The overall objective of the project is to obtain annual estimates of fall
(October) standing stock for chinook fry in principal spawning tributaries and
the mainstem of the lower Thompson River, and to describe, quantitatively, the
uncertainty associated with these estimates. The work will be completed by an
independent contractor who conducted similar studies previously (200-2012) and
is familiar with the area and study design.

The field work will consist of calibrated night snorkeling surveys (Hagen et
al. 2010) in the Lower Thompson River System including all major spawning
tributaries (Nicola, Coldwater, Spius, Deadman, Criss, Bonaparte, and Thompson
River mainstem) and subsequent data analysis and reporting over the winter
months. It will draw closely on the previous steelhead and Chinook juvenile
assessments completed by the contractor in the lower Thompson River system for
both the design of field and analysis methods. Results from this work will
contribute to the time series of juvenile abundance gathered over 10 years
from 2001 to 2012 and the subsequent analysis.

This information will contribute to an assessment of ongoing impacts of the
historic 2021 flood on Nicola 42 Chinook egg-to-fry survival and recruitment
and will lead to a better understanding of the impacts of catastrophic
flooding on salmonids generally and provide specific insights into Nicola
recruitment and juvenile use of the post flood system. This information may
provide insights into management decisions as well as on prioritizing
watershed restoration activities. Additionally, this project could build on
the previous fry assessment work to provide useful information about stock
productivity and carrying capacity, and aid in developing escapement goals and
recovery planning.
