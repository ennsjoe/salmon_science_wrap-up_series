**Lead(s):**   
**Division:**   
**Section:**   
**PSSI Pillar:**   
**Session(s):** Fisheries Monitoring And Harvest Methods  
**Presentation Date(s):** December 10, 2025  
**Speakers:**   
**Overview:**  
This project will build on a previously funded Fisheries Related Incidental Mortality (FRIM) study led by the Sport Fishing Institute to expand the work to include Coho salmon, in addition to Chinook. This study will utilize best practices developed in the previous study to better understand FRIM in the recreational Coho fishery on West Coast Vancouver Island, and will be further advanced by a new component to study affects of fisheries interactions on fish metabolism. This information will be used to expand the Best Practices Handbook developed in 2020.
