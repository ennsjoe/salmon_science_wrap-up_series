**Overview:**  
The goal of this project is to identify reference points and rebuilding
targets for Pacific salmon by pairing Indigenous knowledge systems with
Western science within a knowledge co-production paradigm. Knowledge co-
production can be defined as ‚Äúthe process of bringing together two different
knowledge systems, in true partnership and equity, to enhance, learn, and
create new understandings on a specific topic.‚Äù (Ellam Yua et al. 2022).

Analytical methods for identifying limit reference points have been developed
for Pacific salmon (DFO 2022a) based on Western science, but these have not
considered Indigenous Knowledge which was identified as a gap within CSAS
review (DFO 2022a, b). ‚ÄòUpper stock references‚Äô (delineating ‚Äòcritical‚Äô and
‚Äòcautious‚Äô zones of status) and rebuilding targets are components of the DFO‚Äôs
Precautionary Approach Framework and the Fish Stocks provisions under the
Fisheries Act, but guidance on identifying them is currently lacking for
Pacific salmon. The Fisheries Act further enables the consideration of
Indigenous Knowledge in management, such as in the development of rebuilding
targets and reference points, but there is limited/no precedents for this for
Pacific salmon.

Pairing Indigenous knowledge systems and Western science in the development of
reference points and targets is a step towards ensuring that rebuilding is
inclusive of Nations‚Äô ontologies, including their definitions for ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô
and ‚Äòrebuilt‚Äô. First Nations have a precedence of knowledge that includes
generations of place-based observations that cannot be recreated, or
necessarily measured quantitatively. This project, partnered with the Ha‚Äôoom
Fisheries Society, will explore how to include this alongside or within
Western science ideas of status assessment and rebuilding. Methods will be co-
created with First Nations partners; we anticipate that they will include a
combination of interviews, facilitated discussions, literature reviews, and
meta-analyses. In particular, we will identify what levels and attributes are
considered ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô or ‚Äòrebuilt‚Äô for salmon populations and where ‚Äòserious
harm‚Äô is expected to occur, including life-history, distributional, and
habitat characteristics.

The project will be co-led with the Five Nations (Ahousaht, Ehattesaht,
Mowachaht/Muchalaht, Hesquiaht and Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations) that are
represented by the Ha‚Äôoom Fisheries Society, with a focus on relationship
building and addressing Indigenous needs and values. Bringing Indigenous
knowledge systems and Western science together will lead to more equitable and
inclusive outcomes, supporting the aims of reconciliation and furthering the
capacity for Indigenous self governance. Achieving sustainability of salmon
fisheries cannot be achieved through a Western scientific lens alone;
incorporating Indigenous Knowledge Systems and a broader perspective on what
is considered healthy and serious harm in salmon ecosystems will be essential.
The costs in year 1 will be supported in part by Five Nations Funding through
DFO‚Äôs Treaties and Reconciliation Agreements Program.
