## PSSI Project Summary

**Division:** Stock Assessment and Research (StAR)  
**Section:** Yukon/Transboundary Rivers Area Salmon Stock Assessment  
**Organization:** DFO  
**Session(s):** Fisheries Monitoring And Harvest Methods  
**Presentation Date(s):** December 09, 2025  
**Speakers:** Brendan Connors, Adam O'Dell  
**Abstract:**  
Yukon River Chinook numbers have been declining and a questionable proportion of returning adults do not migrate past the border between Alaska and Canada. This transboundary tracking study uses radio-telemetry from towers and arial surveys to expand Alaska’s Chinook tagging efforts and locate the area and cause of the drop in numbers using death rate, migration speed, and timing.
