**Division:** Stock Assessment and Research (StAR)  
**Section:** Yukon/Transboundary Rivers Area Salmon Stock Assessment  
**Session(s):** Freshwater Stressors  
**Presentation Date(s):** December 02, 2025  
**Speakers:** Brendan Connors, Adam O'Dell  
**Overview:**  
Yukon River Chinook numbers have been declining and a questionable proportion of returning adults do not migrate past the border between Alaska and Canada. This transboundary tracking study uses radio-telemetry from towers and arial surveys to expand Alaskaâ€™s Chinook tagging efforts and locate the area and cause of the drop in numbers using death rate, migration speed, and timing.
