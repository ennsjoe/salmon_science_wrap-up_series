## PSSI Project Summary

**Division:** Ecosystem Sciences (ESD)  
**Section:** Regional Ecosystems Effects on Fish and Fisheries  
**Organization:** DFO  
**Session(s):** Fish Health  
**Presentation Date(s):** December 11, 2025  
**Speakers:** Reid Williams  
**Abstract:**  
Chronic stress is often detrimental to the health and reproductive success of salmon, yet reliably measuring it is difficult. Recently, the stress hormone (cortisol) content of scales has shown potential in this regard. This lab study compares scale and plasma cortisol content of Chinook Salmon smolt under acute stress, and a combined chronic osmotic and thermal stress to evaluate the usability of scale cortisol as a biomarker of chronic stress under environmental stressors such as climate change.
