**Session(s):** Hatcheries  
**Presentation Date(s):** December 09, 2025  
**Speakers:** Eric Rondeau, Tim Healy, Kyle Wellband  
**Overview:**  
Salmon bred from a hatchery are often less fit in wild environments than naturally bred salmon. However, this situation can change using different hatchery methods. This genetic study compares DNA samples from returning hatchery Chinook to natural Chinook in Sarita River to see if hatchery methods improve the spawning success of hatchery Chinook.
