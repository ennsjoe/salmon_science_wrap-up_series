## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Eric Rondeau, Tim Healy, Kyle Wellband  
**Division:** Aquatic Diagnostics, Genomics and Technology (ADGT)  
**Section:** Molecular Genetics  
**PSSI Pillar:** 2-Salmon enhancement  
**Speaker Theme:** Genetics and adaptation  

**Overview:**  
Jacks (males that return a year early) are a natural source of genetic diversity for Chinook, but too many jacks in a population can have limited breeding success and reduce the body size of the population. Hatchery breeding increases the number of jacks, and hatchery staff screen out jacks by body size, which is uncertain. This genetic monitoring study samples male Chinook tissues from the Chilliwack, Puntledge, and Qualicum rivers to sequence the genes, compare the y-chromosome haplotypes specific to jacks, and develop a rapid screening test for broodstock selection.   

**Activities:**  
1) Analyze genotype-phenotype associations between genetic variants and the age of return among Atnarko River Chinook Salmon.
2) Analyze sex chromosome haplotypes in female Chinook salmon from the Atnarko, Chilliwack, Puntledge and Qualicum Rivers to confirm sex-specific haplotypes. 
3) Collect a parallel dataset for genotype-phenotype associations between genetic variants and age of return in Coho Salmon populations with concerns regarding high rates of jack males. 
4) Publish the Chinook Salmon dataset.
