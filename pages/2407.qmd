title: "Follow the Fish: An integrated Chinook salmon assessment and monitoring program for the West Coast of Vancouver Island"
description: "Juvenile Chinook salmon utilize nearshore marine ecosystems along the West Coast during their first marine year. This monitoring project samples juvenile Chinook during year-round salmon surveys in estuarine and marine waters along the WCVI. Researchers are characterizing fish distribution and health (condition, diet, growth) to understanding what factors may be limiting early marine survival."

## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Jessy Bokvist  
**Division:** Stock Assessment and Research (StAR)  
**Section:** South Coast Area Salmon Stock Assessment  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  
**Speaker Theme:** Salmon population monitoring and assessment  

**Overview:**  
Juvenile Chinook salmon utilize nearshore marine ecosystems along the West Coast during their first marine year. This monitoring project samples juvenile Chinook during year-round salmon surveys in estuarine and marine waters along the WCVI. Researchers are characterizing fish distribution and health (condition, diet, growth) to understanding what factors may be limiting early marine survival.   

**Activities:**  
Year 4: Complete the final year of Barkley Sound purse seine surveys in collaboration with Huu-ay-aht First Nation (May through September) to intercept juvenile WCVI Chinook, halt spring outmigration and fall/winter microtrolling surveys. Finish dissections of lethal juvenile Chinook samples collected across all surveys in Year 3 of the program, submit samples for processing, and hand-off tissues to other PI's under Follow the Fish for their analysis. Submit the DNA samples from Year 4 Barkley Purse seining and pending receival of results in FY25-26 start dissecting stocks of interest. Build on data reports completed in Year 3 with new data as it becomes available (genetic stock identification, stomach contents etc.) and create new reports with stomach content analysis and scale growth data with data obtained to date. Create a master merged dataset for sharing with Follow the Fish group for synthesis analyses and products and participate in working groups to complete these analyses. Prepare findings for contribution to the WCVI Chinook rebuilding plan review in April 2026.
