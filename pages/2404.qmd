title: "Improving baseline knowledge of environmental conditions in Vancouver Islands fjords through observations and modelling, with a focus on hypoxia dynamics, climate change, and the potential implications for Pacific salmon"
description: "Low-oxygen (hypoxia) conditions have been observed near the surface in salmon migration inlets on west coast Vancouver Island. The ecosystem monitoring component of this study measures salinity, temperature, and oxygen at different depths in Clayoquot Sound fjords in collaboration with Indigenous groups to establish present-day baseline conditions. The modelling component helps understand the drivers of hypoxia and how they may change in the future. Will salmon have to face more or less hypoxic conditions while migrating?"

**Overview:**  
Low-oxygen (hypoxia) conditions have been observed near the surface in salmon migration inlets on west coast Vancouver Island. The ecosystem monitoring component of this study measures salinity, temperature, and oxygen at different depths in Clayoquot Sound fjords in collaboration with Indigenous groups to establish present-day baseline conditions. The modelling component helps understand the drivers of hypoxia and how they may change in the future. Will salmon have to face more or less hypoxic conditions while migrating?   

**Activities:**  
The expected outcomes for the fiscal year 2025-26 are the following:

a.  Solidify and continue the CTD monitoring program in Clayoquot Sound, with monthly sampling carried out by the local FN. Deliverables: datasets of vertical profiles of salinity, temperature, and oxygen for all the fjords of the sound (several stations per fjord to guarantee appropriate spatial coverage)

b.  Improve coupled physical-biogeochemical simulations for the WCVI model, including simulations and analysis of a future scenario with a focus on Clayoquot Sound. Deliverables: model outputs in netcdf format and a publication in preparation or submitted. 

c.  Support DFO-led fieldwork (both at the field and at the workshop, where instruments get prepared and sometimes fabricated, particularly the weather stations) and support the data management and quality assurance of the observational datasets created through this program. Deliverables: Faster access to quality-controlled data from the CTD monitoring program as well as atmospheric observations (winds, humidity, radiation, etc.) within the fjords in the WCVI.
