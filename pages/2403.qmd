## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Katie Davidson  
**Division:** Stock Assessment and Research (StAR)  
**Section:** South Coast Area Salmon Stock Assessment  
**Location:** ["San Juan River","Port San Juan","4 Mile Creek"]  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Salmon Monitoring  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  

**Overview:**  
The San Juan River is major watershed on southwest Vancouver Island (near Port
Renfrew, BC) that supports distinct populations of Chinook, Coho and Chum,
with Chinook enhanced annually at the 4 Mile Hatchery. Although logging
throughout the watershed has resulted in considerable gravel deposition and
bank erosion along the spawning reaches of the river, there is still an
extensive intact estuary connecting the San Juan and Gordon Rivers that
provides valuable rearing habitat for juvenile salmon. The San Juan River
empties into Port San Juan (PFMA 20-2).

Pacheedaht First Nationâ€™s Salmon Stewardship Program conducts monitoring and
restoration work in and around the San Juan-Gordon watersheds to mitigate
logging effects and rebuild salmon stocks. Their monitoring work spans the
salmon lifecycle and includes investigating impacts of redd scour on egg-to-
fry survival, documenting juvenile salmon habitat use in the estuary, and
conducting adult spawner surveys. Recently, they have also launched a pilot
Chinook mass-marking program with the 4 Mile Hatchery to reduce the impacts of
hatchery genetics on the wild Chinook population through selective removals of
adipose-clipped Chinook in terminal fisheries (community/FSC, and potentially
sport).

These activities all inform the San Juan Chinook Rebuilding Plan currently in
development by Pacheedaht, which will feed into the broader WCVI Chinook
Rebuilding Plan in development by DFO (required under the Fish Stock
Provisions Act for naturally-produced WCVI Chinook, due March 2024) (DFO 2022;
Minister of Justice 2022). However, the recent WCVI Chinook Risk Assessment
process identified several knowledge gaps, mostly related to early freshwater
and marine life cycle stages. For San Juan Chinook specifically, juvenile data
from these life stages (and interactions between hatchery and wild juveniles)
are sparse, and spawner abundance data are limited in scope not only for
Chinook, but also Coho and Chum.

These reasons make the San Juan River a good candidate to develop an
integrated life history monitoring program in alignment with the larger Follow
The Fish program. We propose to continue work initiated in 2022-2023 that
collected data across four life stages of San Juan Chinook, thus complementing
Pacheedahtâ€™s established programs. First, we will implement a rotary screw
trap to intercept naturally-produced out-migrating juveniles (all species, but
focused on spring juvenile Chinook migration timing), allowing us to compare
natural migration timing to hatchery release timing and to gather baseline
biological traits relative to hatchery releases (e.g., size, condition). If
funding and resources permit, a feasibility mark-recapture to obtain a
relative abundance estimate for naturally-produced juvenile Chinook will be
implemented. Second, we will conduct biweekly purse seining in Port San Juan
during summer months (~May-August) to collect mixed-stock information,
including hatchery/natural-origin of juvenile Chinook, stock ID, biological
traits, environmental stress responses (through gill clips), relative
abundance, and information on other species schooling with Chinook (e.g.,
Coho, Pacific Herring). Third, we will continue winter microtrolling work in
Port San Juan that began in 2021 as part of the Follow The Fish project, which
will collect detailed biological information (similar to purse seining data)
on overwintering juvenile Chinook and Coho. We will also calibrate
microtrolling and purse seining methods through simultaneous sampling events.
Fourth, we will deploy a Garmin LiveScope hydroacoustic fish-finder in the San
Juan River to enumerate early, mid and late run salmon. Pairing the LiveScope
with species composition data from the 4 Mile Hatchery fence and snorkel
surveys will allow us to compare methods and potentially calibrate escapement
estimates. Most of Pacheedahtâ€™s community/Food, Social and Ceremonial (FSC)
salmon harvest is directed at Coho due to prolonged low returns of Chinook;
improved adult Coho enumeration (Late-run Coho in particular) has been
identified by Pacheedaht as critical in order to sustainably manage their
community Coho fishery.

We focus on Chinook due to the reasons mentioned previously (e.g., Rebuilding
Plans) and for linkages to other programs currently funded under PSSI Pillar
1.1 such as Follow The Fish (DM Apps Project ID 2407) and Ecological
Indicators (DM Apps Project ID 2414). Our budget reflects costs for expanding
feasibility studies in Year 1 (2022-2023), including technician time to
support not only San Juan work but also Ecological Indicators and occasionally
Follow The Fish (we plan to share technician resources among all projects as
much as possible). However, our work will also provide data on other salmon
species in the San Juan watershed of interest to DFO and Pacheedaht.
Pacheedaht employ a team of highly skilled technicians and biologists, and are
well placed to eventually lead much of this work in future, following a brief
period of investment, capacity building, and project development supported by
DFO.
