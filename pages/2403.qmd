**Overview:**  
Pacheedaht First Nation (PFN) have extensive monitoring and restoration projects underway in the San Juan Watershed, but some data gaps for San Juan Chinook still exist, and more detailed biological sampling is required. DFO Salmon Stock Assessment and PFN developed a holistic lifecycle monitoring program for San Juan Chinook through operation of a freshwater rotary screw trap, marine purse seining, and microtrolling, allowing researchers to monitor Chinook across all life stages and compare traits of natural and hatchery origin.
