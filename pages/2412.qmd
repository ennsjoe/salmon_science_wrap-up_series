**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Innovation & Diagnostics  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  

**Overview:**  
In recent years, the Northeast Pacific has experienced regular heatwaves and
upwelling events (i.e. movement of waters, often acidified, from depth to
coastal shallows). These acute stressor events are predicted to increase in
both duration and frequency due to climate change (FrÃ¶licher et al., 2018).
The proposed project will examine the impacts of warming and upwelling events
(with acidified water) on the nutritional status of Limacina helicina, a cold-
water pteropod that serves as an important dietary item for juvenile Pacific
salmon species in the Northern Pacific (Brodeur et al., 2007; Doubleday &amp;
Hopcroft, 2015; Sturdevant et al., 2012). For example, dietary analyses of
juvenile pink salmon and sockeye salmon within the Gulf of Alaska have shown a
predominance of L. helicina (Brodeur et al., 2007; Doubleday &amp; Hopcroft, 2015;
Sturdevant et al., 2012). Research has demonstrated that shell development,
growth, and survival of L. helicina are all highly susceptible to warming and
ocean acidification (Manno et al., 2017), but there has been limited
investigation of impacts to pteropod nutritional quality (i.e. composition)
under the context of acute stressor events. Prey nutritional quality is a key
aspect of feeding ecology that directly contributes to the survival of higher
trophic species (Ahlgren et al., 2005; Daly et al., 2010). In salmon,
variation in invertebrate prey quantity and quality may influence growth and
survival, especially during early marine residence (Litz et al., 2019).
Altered dietary lipid levels, for example, have been linked to changes in fish
growth, fat deposition, and digestive enzyme activity (Pelusio et al., 2021).
Consequently, we propose that any change in the nutritive status of L.
helicina under climate stressor conditions could have carry-over impacts to
juvenile salmon growth, health, and survival.
