## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Amy Long  
**Division:** Aquatic Diagnostics, Genomics and Technology (ADGT)  
**Section:** Aquatic Animal Health  
**Location:** ["Pacific Biological Station","Fulton Hatchery","Nadina Spawning Channels","Chehalis River Hatchery","Quinsam River","Inch Creek Hatchery","Nanaimo River Hatchery","Big Qualicum River Hatchery"]  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Hatchery Science  
**PSSI Pillar:** 2-Salmon enhancement  

**Overview:**  
Historically, DFOâ€™s Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP) has collaborated with
the Science Branchâ€™s Aquatic Animal Health (AAH) Section to successfully
implement disease monitoring and mitigation programs across SEP facilities
with the goal of ameliorating endemic diseases in salmonid hatcheries. With
the continual depletion of funds available for salmon health research in both
SEP and Science Branch, diagnostic capacity of the finfish diagnostic
laboratory (FDL) at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) has not kept pace
with new technologies, and there is limited technology transfer between
Science Branch and SEP. The anticipated outcomes of this project are to re-
establish the linkage between SEP and the Science Branch and to use the
expertise of the Science Branch to improve, expand, and modernize the FDL. In
doing so, this will provide SEP with the information necessary to provide
long-term support for the enhanced capacity of the FDL. This multi-year
project will result in a proactive approach to optimizing salmonid hatchery
health management and will be accomplished through the completion of the
following objectives.
