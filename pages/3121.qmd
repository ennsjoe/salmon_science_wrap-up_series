## ðŸ“‹ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband  
**Division:** NA  
**Section:** Molecular Genetics  
**PSSI Pillar:** NA  
**Session:** Hatcheries  
**Presentation Date:** February 04, 2031  
**Speakers:** Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband  
**Hosts:** Kyle Wellband  

**Overview:**  
NA   

**Activities:**  
1) Collaboratively identify an appropriate and feasible set of four Chinook populations for the study, 2) obtain gametes from the four populations, and 3) conduct the within- and between-population crosses. Hatching success and physiological performance will be assessed in the following fiscal year.
