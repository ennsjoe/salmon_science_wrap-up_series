## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband  
**Division:** N/A  
**Section:** Molecular Genetics  
**PSSI Pillar:** Unspecified  
**Speaker Theme:** Hatchery science  

**Overview:**  
No description available.   

**Activities:**  
1) Collaboratively identify an appropriate and feasible set of four Chinook populations for the study, 2) obtain gametes from the four populations, and 3) conduct the within- and between-population crosses. Hatching success and physiological performance will be assessed in the following fiscal year.
