title: "Climate Downscaling for salmon conservation in Marine Ecosystems"
description: "Ocean and climate conditions influence salmon numbers and health. While efforts have been made to model future climate conditions, these models are broad in scope which creates a scale gap when applying projections to salmon habitat. This modelling project downscales broader global climate models to include coastal environments and salmon species distribution."

**Overview:**  
Ocean and climate conditions influence salmon numbers and health. While efforts have been made to model future climate conditions, these models are broad in scope which creates a scale gap when applying projections to salmon habitat. This modelling project downscales broader global climate models to include coastal environments and salmon species distribution.
