title: "Climate Downscaling for salmon conservation in Marine Ecosystems"
description: "Ocean and climate conditions influence salmon numbers and health. While efforts have been made to model future climate conditions, these models are broad in scope which creates a scale gap when applying projections to salmon habitat. This modelling project downscales broader global climate models to include coastal environments and salmon species distribution."

## ðŸ“‹ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Di Wan, James Christian  
**Division:** Ocean Sciences (OSD)  
**Section:** Ocean Modelling and Prediction  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  
**Session:** Salmon in a changing climate  
**Presentation Date:** February 04, 2024  
**Speakers:** Di Wan, James Christian  
**Hosts:** Patrick Thompson  

**Overview:**  
Ocean and climate conditions influence salmon numbers and health. While efforts have been made to model future climate conditions, these models are broad in scope which creates a scale gap when applying projections to salmon habitat. This modelling project downscales broader global climate models to include coastal environments and salmon species distribution.   

**Activities:**  
Analysis of NEP36, CREG025, and CREG12 simulations.
