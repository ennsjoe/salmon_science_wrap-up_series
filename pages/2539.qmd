title: "Climate Downscaling for salmon conservation in Marine Ecosystems"
---

## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Di Wan, James Christian  
**Division:** Ocean Sciences (OSD)  
**Section:** Ocean Modelling and Prediction  
**Location:**   

**Overview:**  
Ocean and climate conditions influence salmon numbers and health. While efforts have been made to model future climate conditions, these models are broad in scope which creates a scale gap when applying projections to salmon habitat. This modelling project downscales broader global climate models to include coastal environments and salmon species distribution.
