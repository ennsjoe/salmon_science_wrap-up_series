title: "Quantifying Yukon Chinook migration mortality and its implications for fisheries management and rebuilding under the Fish Stock Provisions of the Fisheries Act"
description: "Yukon River Chinook numbers have been declining and a questionable proportion of returning adults do not migrate past the border between Alaska and Canada. This transboundary tracking study uses radio-telemetry from towers and arial surveys to expand Alaskaâ€™s Chinook tagging efforts and locate the area and cause of the drop in numbers using death rate, migration speed, and timing."
