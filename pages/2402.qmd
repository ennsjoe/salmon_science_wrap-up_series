## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Brendan Connors, Adam O'Dell  
**Division:** Stock Assessment and Research (StAR)  
**Section:** Yukon/Transboundary Rivers Area Salmon Stock Assessment  
**Location:** ["Yukon River"]  

**Overview:**  
Yukon River Chinook numbers have been declining and a questionable proportion of returning adults do not migrate past the border between Alaska and Canada. This transboundary tracking study uses radio-telemetry from towers and arial surveys to expand Alaskaâ€™s Chinook tagging efforts and locate the area and cause of the drop in numbers using death rate, migration speed, and timing.
