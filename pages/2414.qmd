## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Diana McHugh  
**Division:** Stock Assessment and Research (StAR)  
**Section:** South Coast Area Salmon Stock Assessment  
**Location:** N/A  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Ecosystem Monitoring  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  

**Overview:**  
To support the Chinook Rebuilding Planning process, we need to collect
additional ecological data including water quality measurements and benthic
invertebrate surveys in order to fill some of the gaps identified in the data
available in the Habitat Risk Assessments. The initial program developed for a
few systems on the west coast, should be maintained and expanded to cover
additional systems, where there is particular concern and local support. With
a reduced budget, one technician will coordinate with other available techs to
visit index systems and maintain equipment opportunistically. Short-term
Priority systems: Kaouk, Leiner, Bedwell/Ursus, San Juan, and Sarita Secondary
systems: Clemens, Conuma, Nahmint, Somass, Cayeghle, Marble, Nitinat, Sugsaw,
Nimpkish
