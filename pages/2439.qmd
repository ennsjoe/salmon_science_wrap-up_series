**Overview:**  
The Application of Fourier Transform-Near Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-NIR) for
Fish Ageing.

Demographic information such as age is critical for conservation management of
commercially and ecologically important fishes (Ricker1975; Hilborn and
Walters 1992; Campana and Thorrold 2001). Traditional fish age estimations are
determined by microscopically counting growth zones in a number of different
hard structures including scales and otoliths, a highly specialized skill that
requires years of training (Campana, 1992; Hesler et al., 2019). DFO Science
Sclerochronology lab provides internal and external DFO clients with age
estimates for numerous species of groundfish, pelagics, shellfish and salmon
including chinook, coho, chum and sockeye. This information contributes to
internal stock assessments and international treaties such as The Pacific
Salmon Treaty. The Sclerochronology lab is currently transitioning from a team
consisting of more senior agers to junior agers, a transition that will reduce
the lab output capacity. As such, the Sclerochronology lab is investigating
new methodologies with the potential of increasing fish ageing capacity and
efficiency. Fourier Transform-Near Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-NIRS) has
recently been applied to rapidly predict fish age, gaining attention among
fisheries managers as a potential alternative to timely and costly production
ageing of managed species (Passerotti et al., 2020). Age prediction capability
of FT-NIRS has been tested on the otoliths of chinook salmon (Claiborne et
al., 2019), walleye pollock (Hesler et al., 2019), red snapper (Passerotti et
al., 2020), barramundi (Wright et al., 2021), Pacific cod (Healy et al.,
2021), longnose skate (Arrington et al., 2021) as well as the vertebrae of two
shark species (Rigby et al. 2014, 2016), with potentially promising results.
Studies on eastern Bering Sea walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) have shown
that ages derived from FT-NIRS are not only precise but may demonstrate less
bias than traditional ageing methods (Helser et al., 2018).

Studies conducted by collaborators at NOAA have indicated that FT-NIRS has the
capacity to increase age outputs of walleye pollock from 35 ages per day to
360 ages per day (Hesler et al., 2019). If successful, new applications of FT-
NIRS technology will provide a promising approach to consolidate research
tools, operationalize timely data collection methods for age determination
directly benefiting fisheries researchers and managers, as well as other
research projects led by StAR, SEP, and Indigenous communities.

The overall objective of the proposed work is a proof of concept to establish
that the FT-NIRS can be used to precisely estimate the age of fishes regularly
assessed by the Sclerochronology lab, including the routinely aged salmon
species of chinook, coho, chum, and sockeye. Since salmon are aged using scale
structures, our research will first focus on fish species that are aged by
otoliths. Once we are familiar with the equipment and techniques and have
successfully passed the proof-of-concept phase, a range of new research
questions can be investigated such as determining whether salmon scales can be
scanned for precise age estimation.
