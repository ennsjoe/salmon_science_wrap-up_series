## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Sue Grant  
**Division:** Ecosystem Sciences (ESD)  
**Section:** Regional Ecosystems Effects on Fish and Fisheries  
**Location:** N/A  
**Status:** New  
**Theme:** Unspecified  
**PSSI Pillar:** Unspecified  

**Overview:**  
State of Pacific Salmon 2024 Report: This has been requested by ESD Division
Manager (Eddy Kennedy) and RDS (Andy Thomson) and also expectations that this
is completed through PSSI leads (Sarah Murdoch and Wes Shoemaker) as part of
PSSI.

This report will update the previous State of Salmon report in 2019: technical
report: https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/species-especes/publications/salmon-
saumon/state-etat-2019/abstract-resume/index-eng.html and accompanying e-book
were published: https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/species-especes/publications/salmon-
saumon/state-etat-2019/ebook/index-eng.html. This also builds on a broad
recent North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) status report led by
DFO&#39;s State of the Salmon Program, and our Alaskan Chair, with support from
Stock Assessment Science group, and International Year of the Salmon (IYS) and
parties of NPAFC. It will also tie in a recent SOS report on climate change
adaptation: https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-
bibliotheque/41213531.pdf

With the publishing of DFO&#39;s rapid status approach to assess status and limit
reference points (LRPs), we will use this Scanner as the foundation of SOS
reporting. DFO&#39;s Scanner is an interactive data visualization tool that
presents salmon WSP status and trends information within a mapping interface.
By using the Scanner we can compare and contrast salmon CU trends in the
Pacific Region. Currently Fraser salmon CUs and select North coast and
southern BC Chinook CUs are available in the Scanner. Information provided by
experts, combined with their use of the Scanner results will form the
foundation on state of salmon reporting. Including First Nations observations
will be an additional objective of the SOS reporting. How to include Western
Science and Indigenous knowledge as two separate streams of knowledge will be
explored. The report will provide trends and statuses and key narratives on
the State of Pacific Salmon. This extends on annual reporting that has been
done through State of the Pacific Ocean (salmon trends) and the Integrated
Fisheries Management Plans (IFMPs) for environmental conditions for the
upcoming return year.
