**Overview:**  
There is little doubt that commercial, recreational, and FSC fisheries have
contributed to the decline of several Pacific salmon stocks in British
Columbia (BC). However, there are a multitude of non-fishing threats facing BC
salmon that have not been fully identified nor characterized including Aquatic
Invasive Species (AIS), harmful algal blooms (HABs), disease and pathogens,
persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals, etc. Further, many of these
stressors can interact such that the cumulative effect of these stressors is
likely greater than the sum of individual stressors. However, these stressors
are unlikely evenly distributed across the Pacific such that different stocks
will face different stressors and may respond differently. Thus, spatial and
stock considerations will be critical. Finally, these stressors are affecting
BC salmon at different life history stages across the freshwater, estuarine,
and marine systems they utilize to complete their life cycle with climate
change exacerbating the problem. By developing a decision support framework it
will be possible to identify and characterize the individual and multiple
stressors affecting salmon productivity or recovery in a standardized way
among Pacific salmon stocks. This will allow managers to better incorporate
and mitigate these non-fishing stressors most impacting salmon in decision
making. Not only will this conveying a more complete understanding of stock
status and threats to industry, stakeholders, and First Nations it will
facilitate the inclusion of this information in fisheries management plans and
SARA recovery plans. Further, this approach will allow targeting limited
resources to those stressors that can best be managed with a clearer
understanding of how salmon may be expected to respond when these threats are
mitigated.  
Based on the non-fishing threats identified in the previous year, along with
their expected impacts on BC salmon stocks, we will develop a geospatial
dataset of these threats that can then be attributed to individual stocks. By
developing an interaction matrix it will be possible to specify the stock-
specific threats facing BC salmon and clearly indicate which management
decision making processes need to include this information (e.g., fishing
plan, recovery plan).

At the Nov 2022 workshop our breakout group identified a number of known
stressors and in some cases we were able to identify specific threats to
salmon. However, we had a much longer list of potential stressors for which we
did not have subject matter experts. Thus, the first step will be to hire a
dedicated BI-02 who will undertake a literature review, including Fisheries
Management Plans, CSAS Advisory Documents, SARA Recovery Potential Assessments
and Recovery Plans, to identify a range of non-fishing stressors affecting
salmon and how DFO currently considers/doesnâ€™t consider them in decision
making. The second step will be to talk to subject matter experts both withing
and outside DFO to fill information gaps that are identified during the
initial review. This preliminary list will then be used in the third step,
targeted workshops, where the experts will work to identify the causal
mechanisms behind these stressors (e.g., life history stage affected, type of
impact, duration, intensity, magnitude, recovery, etc.) and how they can be
better considered in DFO decision making. This dual approach of literature
review and expert opinions has been used previously to identify stressors
impacting kelp recovery in the Salish Sea (Hollarsmith et al. 2022).

Based on the results of the first two years of the project, the third year
will specifically develop decision support tools that will aid managers in how
best to incorporate non-fishing threats across an array of DFO management and
policy decision making processes, including, but not limited to Fisheries
Management, SARA recovery planning, SEP restoration activities, and FFHPP
integrated planning processes. Further, by developing this in conjunction with
First Nations, it will expand on existing DFOâ€™s efforts on Reconciliation.
