**Overview:**  
The abundance of many Pacific salmon populations has remained below management
reference points for decades despite large reductions in exploitation rates. A
common paradigm is that poor marine survival has constrained recovery;
however, the mechanisms (e.g. predation vs. starvation) leading to mortality
and at which life stages they operate remain unclear. One specific hypothesis
is that large aggregations of Steller sea lions intercept Fraser River sockeye
salmon (10 of 24 CUs threatened or endangered (COSEWIC 2017)) north of
Vancouver Island during return migrations. Yet little is known about sea lion
foraging behaviour and diet in these remote transitions zones between offshore
and coastal areas and even less is known about salmon mortality rates. Our
proposal outlines a field program to addresses salmon and pinniped components
simultaneously. This work will employ leading edge technologies to generate
hard data on sources of salmon mortality and specifically the degree of
pinniped mortality, moving us/debate/issue beyond the realm of conjecture and
inference. Although this document describes a sockeye salmon-sea lion field
program, we emphasize that our proposal is modular in that one or both species
components can be pursued, and the framework could focus on alternative
pinniped species, salmon species or salmon life stages based on departmental
priorities (e.g. harbor seal impacts on juvenile Chinook salmon); however the
costs associated with tagging juvenile salmonids will be considerably higher.

We will estimate sea lion predation on adult sockeye salmon as they migrate
past Triangle Island, off the northern tip of Vancouver Island. This region is
the site of the largest Steller sea lion rookery in the world and is
hypothesized to be a survival bottleneck that disproportionately impacts
Fraser River sockeye salmon productivity (e.g. Walters et al. 2020). Salmon-
related work would quantify predation impacts via multiple complementary
tagging technologies. After capturing sockeye salmon via purse seine near
Haida Gwaii, we will use satellite tags to quantify guild-specific predation
rates (e.g. cetacean, pinniped, shark) based on depth and temperature sensors,
to generate high resolution estimates of salmon habitat use, and to estimate
diversion rates that may moderate predation impacts (i.e. migrations through
Juan de Fuca rather than Johnstone Strait). We will leverage existing acoustic
telemetry infrastructure in the northern Strait of Georgia, that will increase
the precision of mortality rate estimates at relatively low cost. Pinniped-
related work will include complementary methods (fatty acids, stable isotopes
and scats) to estimate diets at multiple temporal scales along migration
pathways on either side of Vancouver Island. Pinniped diet analyses will be
complemented by satellite tagging to understand movements, distribution and
foraging behaviour in relation to salmon mortality locations. We wish to
emphasize that these pinniped data will be highly relevant for gauging
predator impacts more broadly, Including other PSSI initiatives.

For the salmon component, Y1 (FY 2023-24) will be a ramp-up period, with
tagging occurring in Y2 and Y3. For the pinniped component, diet collections
will begin in Y1 and continue through Y3. We will undertake initial satellite
tagging of pinnipeds in Y1 to refine effective protocols and increase tagging
rates in Y2 and Y3. Analytical pipelines for both components will be developed
in Y2 so that final analyses can begin in Y3 and continue through 2026 (PIs
have the capacity to complete analytical work without additional staffing).
Unfortunately salmon tagging will occur during off cycle years; however we
anticipate sufficient numbers of fish will be available to meet our sample
size requirements.

Ultimately data on survival rates and predation are critical to several
management questions. First, total survival rates can provide strategic
information on whether specific life history stages are likely to constrain
recovery (i.e. if survival is high then subsequent efforts should focus on
other stages). Second, information on guild-specific predation rates can
provide information on the utility of targeted management actions (e.g.
fisheries, culls). These data are also key inputs to ongoing life cycle and
ecosystem modeling efforts intended to guide prioritization of Pacific salmon
stocks for rebuilding.
