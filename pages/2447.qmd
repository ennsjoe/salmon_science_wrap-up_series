**Overview:**  
Climate change has negatively impacted productivity of many Canadian Pacific
salmon stocks and species, but the cumulative interplay between environmental
stress and changes to salmon ecosystems impacting survival are still yet to be
fully evaluated. This knowledge is required to identify effective mediation
strategies under anthropogenic control. An innovative salmon Fit-Chip tool is
poised to fill this knowledge gap. The salmon Fit-Chip tool contains curated
biomarker panels that can specifically recognize independent stressors
(thermal, osmotic, hypoxia), disease states (viral), imminent mortality
(natural death within 72 hours), and smolt readiness (differentiating pre-
smolts, smolts and de-smolts), based on profiling from non-lethal gill biopsy
samples. Fit-chips also contain biomarkers associated with inflammation and
immune activation, and can include assays to key pathogens and parasites.

While physical oceanographic monitoring can provide environmental measures of
temperature, oxygen, and salinity, they do not tell us whether fish are
actually experiencing stress, or possibly avoiding areas where these stressors
occur. Fit-Chip data allow us to directly test whether the highest ranking
environmental risk factors identified in the WCVI Marine Risk
Assessments‚Äîelevated temperature summer through early fall and reduced oxygen
in the fall, the moderate risk of carryover effects (in this case smolt
readiness rather than size) and exposure to HABs, cause physiological stress
and impairment in Chinook salmon. Moreover, Fit-Chips can effectively identify
habitats where salmon are least vs most compromised, allowing regulators and
habitat biologists to target remediation where needed most, with remediation
success tracked via decreased stress.

Working within the West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) &quot;Follow the fish
Research Consortium funded under PSSI, under objective 1, we will run Fit-
Chips on 2,000 Chinook released from Robertson and Nitinat hatcheries sampled
over the migration trajectory from freshwater-estuary-marine, including
overwintering Chinook caught across all 5 WCVI sounds through microtrolling
led by local First Nations. Using a south coast wide Fit-Chip dataset
developed in 2022-2023 using PSSI funding, comprised of over 4500 Chinook
sampled from 2008-2018, we will employ stock-recruitment models to identify
associations between individual stressors and population-level survival across
the southern BC coast, and build a new model framework to address the
cumulative interplay between stress and disease undermining survival. This
analysis will address several of the risk factors identified in the WCVI
Marine Risk Assessment for Chinook salmon, including climate-driven
environmental stressors (temperature, hypoxia, salinity) and
pathogens/disease, and their association with survival. We will then apply
this knowledge to our Fit-Chip data on WCVI Chinook collected from 2022-2024,
along with the physical oceanographic data collected at the same time, to
identify where and when environmental stressors are ‚Äúfelt‚Äù by WCVI Chinook,
including their relationship with measured environmental parameters, and where
and when signs of increased morbidity occur. Importantly, this spatial
analysis will also address the anthropogenically controlled intrinsic and
extrinsic factors associated with stressors and diseases that pose the highest
population-level risk to WCVI Chinook. The ultimate goal is to identify
stressor and/or disease impacts that can be effectively mediated to increase
early marine survival of salmon, and habitats where mediation is most urgently
required.

The WCVI Marine Risk Assessments identified prey availability/feeding a high
current and future risk, pathogens/parasites a moderate current and high
future risk, and predation/HABs a moderate risks. Data gaps were identified
for all of these risk factors. While multiple individual projects are proposed
to tackle most of these risk factors and where they are most strongly felt in
Barclay and Clayoquot Sound, eDNA offers a more holistic tool to identify the
species compositions ‚Äì e.g. salmon spp, predators, prey, competitors,
infective agents, HABs, that can corroborate community assessment more
efficiently over a broader spatial scale. Under objective 2, we will carry out
eDNA sampling in the same areas and seasons where the follow the fish project
is actively catching fish, starting in the estuaries and Barclay Sound in
spring/summer, and moving into Clayoquot sound in the early fall and
throughout all five sounds overwinter. In addition to providing an ecosystem
characterization via metabarcoding, and pathogens through our infective agent
monitoring system -- including potential hot-spot areas around
farms/processing plants, eDNA may also provide more information on areas of
the sound where salmon are more or less abundant. Importantly, under this
objective we will integrate data analyses with projects using a more
traditional species assessments (e.g. via plankton sampling, HAB monitoring,
hydroacoustics). Importantly, when contrasting eDNA community compositions in
ecosystems where salmon show indices of optimal vs compromised health, we can
provide a second pillar to develop and measure the effectiveness of mediation
efforts.
