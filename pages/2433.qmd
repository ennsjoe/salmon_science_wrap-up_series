title: "Integrated Salish Sea acoustic monitoring of salmon and salmon prey"
description: "Acoustic tools can provide important information on salmon ecology (food web) and salmon survival in marine areas. These salmon habitat and abundance monitoring studies use multi-frequency echosounders from mooring stations and mobile units in West Coast Vancouver Island sounds and the Salish sea to measure aspects of salmon forage species (zooplankton, krill, and Pacific herring) and count juvenile and adult salmon along their migration."

**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  
**Speaker Theme:** Marine ecosystems and stressors  

**Overview:**  
Acoustic tools can provide important information on salmon ecology (food web) and salmon survival in marine areas. These salmon habitat and abundance monitoring studies use multi-frequency echosounders from mooring stations and mobile units in West Coast Vancouver Island sounds and the Salish sea to measure aspects of salmon forage species (zooplankton, krill, and Pacific herring) and count juvenile and adult salmon along their migration.   

**Activities:**  
The main objectives are:
1) Continue time-series of forage species in the Strait of Georgia (e.g. krill and herring) based on new and existing acoustic surveys
2) Continue time-series of pelagic species in the Strait of Georgia that can be potential predator of juvenile salmon (e.g. Pacific hake and walleye pollock) based on acoustic surveys
3) Continue time-series of large adult Chinook and salmon targets in the Strait of Georgia based on new and existing acoustic surveys
4) Retrieve and redeploy inverted echosounder moorings in key strategic locations within the Salish Sea to get fine-scale temporal time series of juvenile salmon and salmon prey
5) Complement moorings sites with active acoustic surveys
6) Documents methods and key results from these activities
