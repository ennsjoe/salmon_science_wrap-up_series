## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Stephane Gauthier  
**Division:** Ocean Sciences (OSD)  
**Section:** Ecology and Biogeochemistry  
**Location:** ["Salish Sea"]  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Ecosystem Monitoring  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  
**Speaker Theme:** Marine ecosystems and stressors  

**Overview:**  
We propose to create and build on acoustic monitoring within the Salish Sea
with a focus on expanding our understanding of Pacific salmon productivity and
survival along with drivers that can affect them. This concept proposal would
build on a number of current survey efforts as well as proposing new work to
address specific ecosystem aspects. The different components of the proposed
work include: 1) Deployment of autonomous acoustic multi-frequency
echosounders: Moorings have been deployed in the Discovery Passage to track
the timing and intensity of juvenile Pacific salmon out-migration since 2015.
We would continue this monitoring, and add two additional moorings in the
Strait of Georgia / Haro Strait to obtain high temporal and vertical
resolution data on key ecosystem components (zooplankton and krill, juvenile
salmon, forage species, and adult salmon â€“ in particular Chinook due to their
large size). The new mooring positions would be strategically selected to
build on ongoing sampling programs in the Salish Sea. 2) Build on existing
acoustic-trawl surveys in the Strait of Georgia (focused on Pacific Hake and
walleye pollock assessments) to develop spatially-explicit estimates of krill
biomass for the Strait and main inlets, along with information on density and
distribution of forage fish species (e.g. Pacific herring). Other surveys
within the Salish Sea also collect acoustic data that would feed into these
estimates, such as the Spring and Fall juvenile salmon surveys (Neville). 3)
Incorporate portable echosounder systems to complement current zooplankton and
oceanographic sampling efforts (Sastri). 4) Carry out dedicated small-scale
acoustic surveys in targeted areas to assess poorly monitored forage fish
species that are important for salmon, with particular attention to Pacific
Sandlance.
