title: "Intergenerational transfer and parental origins of DNA methylation variation in Coho and Chinook Salmon"
---

## üß¨ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Eric Rondeau, Tim Healy, Kyle Wellband  
**Division:** Aquatic Diagnostics, Genomics and Technology (ADGT)  
**Section:** Molecular Genetics  
**PSSI Pillar:** 2-Salmon enhancement  
**Speaker Theme:** Genetics and adaptation  

**Overview:**  
Chemical reactions in a salmon body decide which genes are expressed in a process called ‚ÄúDNA methylation.‚Äù This hatchery genetics study sequences methylation across the genome to compare between hatchery and natural origin to see if salmon offspring inherit DNA methylation from parents (epigenetics) and how this could inform hatchery breeding methods.   

**Activities:**  
Methylation sequencing of developmental stages in Chinook and/or Coho to assess reprogramming of DNA methylation that would impact intergenerational inheritance.
