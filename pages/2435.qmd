title: "Intergenerational transfer and parental origins of DNA methylation variation in Coho and Chinook Salmon"

## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Eric Rondeau, Tim Healy, Kyle Wellband  
**Division:** Aquatic Diagnostics, Genomics and Technology (ADGT)  
**Section:** Molecular Genetics  
**Location:** ["PBS Nanaimo"]  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Hatchery Science  
**PSSI Pillar:** 2-Salmon enhancement  

**Overview:**  
The objective of this project is to document inheritance of DNA methylation
and identify relative contribution of male and female parents to variation in
methylation observed in their offspring. We will use methylation sequencing of
parents and offspring in hybrid crosses of hatchery and natural origin to
document the presence of methylation in adult tissue that are present in their
offspring. Knowledge of the parental origins and frequency of DNA methylation
inheritance would inform specific breeding guidelines and allow management for
reduced propagation of epigenetic effects.
