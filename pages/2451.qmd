title: "Relative reproductive success of hatchery- versus natural-origin salmon in Canadian integrated populations"
description: "Salmon bred from a hatchery are often less fit in wild environments than naturally bred salmon. However, this situation can change using different hatchery methods. This genetic study compares DNA samples from returning hatchery Chinook to natural Chinook in Sarita River to see if hatchery methods improve the spawning success of hatchery Chinook."

## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Eric Rondeau, Tim Healy, Kyle Wellband  
**Division:** Aquatic Diagnostics, Genomics and Technology (ADGT)  
**Section:** Molecular Genetics  
**PSSI Pillar:** 2-Salmon enhancement  
**Speaker Theme:** Hatchery science  

**Overview:**  
Salmon bred from a hatchery are often less fit in wild environments than naturally bred salmon. However, this situation can change using different hatchery methods. This genetic study compares DNA samples from returning hatchery Chinook to natural Chinook in Sarita River to see if hatchery methods improve the spawning success of hatchery Chinook.   

**Activities:**  
1) Validate natural-origin parentage-based tagging rate for Sarita River Chinook Salmon.
2) Determine genetic relatedness among smolts from natural-origin production compared to smolts from hatchery-origin production.
3) Assess potential for continued use of Sarita River Chinook to estimate RRS of hatchery-origin salmon from SEP facilities.
4) Explore options to increase sampling efforts to approach comprehensive escapement sampling in future years.
5) Continue to explore alternative approaches to enable widespread RRS estimation across SEP hatcheries even in systems where extensively escapement sampling is infeasible.
