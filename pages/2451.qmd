title: "Relative reproductive success of hatchery- versus natural-origin salmon in Canadian integrated populations"
description: "Salmon bred from a hatchery are often less fit in wild environments than naturally bred salmon. However, this situation can change using different hatchery methods. This genetic study compares DNA samples from returning hatchery Chinook to natural Chinook in Sarita River to see if hatchery methods improve the spawning success of hatchery Chinook."

**Overview:**  
Salmon bred from a hatchery are often less fit in wild environments than naturally bred salmon. However, this situation can change using different hatchery methods. This genetic study compares DNA samples from returning hatchery Chinook to natural Chinook in Sarita River to see if hatchery methods improve the spawning success of hatchery Chinook.
