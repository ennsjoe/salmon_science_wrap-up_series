**Overview:**  
Climate change and Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) are leading threats to
biodiversity globally. In British Columbia (BC), many salmon stocks have been
assessed as at-risk by COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife
in Canada), but while climate change has been increasingly considered in
salmon management and policy, the threat posed by AIS has largely been
ignored. Further, stressors like increasing global temperatures are out of the
control of regional management while AIS can be managed locally. By targeting
AIS most likely to have the biggest impact on salmon survival or productivity,
we can improve salmon recovery by reducing the stress that these invasive
species cause. AIS impacts on salmon are well documented in the US Pacific
Northwest where, for example, invasive Walleye consume up to 2 million smolts
a year in the Columbia River (Sanderson et al. 2009). The expansion of
Northern Pike in Alaska has led to the decline of salmon productivity in some
regions and all five salmon species have been classified as highly vulnerable
to pike invasion in at least part of their Alaskan range (Jalbert et al.
2021). Habitat alteration can also impact salmon: Schwoerer et al. (2019)
estimated the potential for $159 million annual damage to the Alaskan Sockeye
salmon industry from one invasive plant species, Elodea. However, the extent
and relative impact of freshwater AIS threats to salmon habitat and
productivity have yet to be assessed in BC. Here we will fill this gap.
