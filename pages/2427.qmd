## ðŸ§¬ Project Summary

**Lead(s):** Akash Sastri, Kelly Young  
**Division:** Ocean Sciences (OSD)  
**Section:** Ecology and Biogeochemistry  
**Location:** ["Strait of Georgia","Salish Sea"]  
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Theme:** Ecosystem Monitoring  
**PSSI Pillar:** 1-Conservation and stewardship  
**Speaker Theme:** Marine ecosystems and stressors  

**Overview:**  
A recent study [Perry et al. 2021, PLOS ONE] identified key physical and
biological (total zooplankton, euphausiid, amphipod, and decapod larvae
biomass) factors describing juvenile chinook and coho survival in the Strait
of Georgia (SoG). This analysis was used to develop a predictive model of
survival. The current sampling frequency is monthly. Increased frequency,
particularly in the spring and fall will allow better resolution of physical
processes and on match-mismatch between juvenile salmon and they prey in the
Strait. Further, increased sampling frequency will improve resolution of
physical measurements which benefit both statistical power and model
prediction. The project expands upon the current monthly SoG plankton survey
program (22 stations) to include additional biweekly surveys starting mid-
February through to mid-April and then again late August through end of
September. These additional surveys would target a key subset of stations
with: 1) sampling focused on the plankton component of juvenile salmon diets
(krill, amphipods, and decapod larvae); 2) biochemical measurements of
zooplankton production rates and photochemical measurements of phytoplankton
production rates; and 3) ancillary measurements required for estimates of food
web energy transfer efficiency. The primary objective is to measure the
quantity, quality, and production rate of a key dietary component as well as
the entire zooplankton community. Variation of zooplankton production rates
are more sensitive than biomass to environmental variation occurring on
timescales relevant to juvenile salmon foraging. Community-level productivity
estimates will be used to measure ecological efficiency; the amount of energy
available to consumers of zooplankton.
