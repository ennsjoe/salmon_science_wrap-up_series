title: "Salish Sea plankton and oceanography"
description: "Zooplankton monitoring in the Strait of Georgia is important to understand the food web and juvenile salmon survival, but the current monthly sampling timing is too low for confident statistics and modelling. This food web monitoring study collects zooplankton and ocean conditions on bi-weekly surveys in the spring and fall to more confidently model salmon diet and health."

**Overview:**  
Zooplankton monitoring in the Strait of Georgia is important to understand the food web and juvenile salmon survival, but the current monthly sampling timing is too low for confident statistics and modelling. This food web monitoring study collects zooplankton and ocean conditions on bi-weekly surveys in the spring and fall to more confidently model salmon diet and health.   

**Activities:**  
This is a continuation of a multi-year monitoring program.
2025-26 priorities:
â€¢	Biweekly (spring) and monthly plankton surveys: February-October
â€¢	Monthly community-level plankton productivity and phytoplankton-zooplankton transfer efficiency measurements in the Central SoG
â€¢	Zooplankton sample enumeration and analysis of temporal patterns of plankton biomass, productivity, transfer efficiency, and oceanography in the Central SoG 
â€¢	Prepare and complete reports/presentations for annual State of the Ocean Meeting.
