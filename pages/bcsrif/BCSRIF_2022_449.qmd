## ðŸ“‹ BCSRIF Project Summary

**Species Group:** Pacific Salmon  
**Location:** Broughton Archipelago.  
**Partners:** None listed  
**Agreement Period:** March 07, 4610301 to October 07, 4861522  
**Session(s):** Freshwater Stressors  
**Presentation Date(s):** December 02, 2025  
**Speakers:** Amy Kamarainen  
**Overview:**  
The project will be four components (i) provide a quantitative and qualitative history of forestry and salmon in Musgamagw Dzawadaâ€™enuxw territory, (ii) quantify the effects of forest harvesting histories on salmon abundance for all Pacific salmon species in coastal BC, (iii) establish a temperature, sedimentation, and dissolved oxygen monitoring system in salmon watersheds of Musgamagw Dzawadaâ€™enuxw territory to quantify stream temperatures and water quality in relation to forestry activity and support a centralized database of stream temperatures coast-wide initiated by the PSF, and (iv) develop a new non-invasive method for studying salmon stress responses using environmental DNA technology and applies it to salmon in relation to temperature and environmental variation across watersheds in Musgamagw Dzawadaâ€™enuxw territory. The project components will thus provide proximate empirical data on the environmental conditions of salmon habitats, salmon stress, growth, and immune responses to their stream environments, as well as population level relationships from salmon and forestry timeseries. The outcomes of the project will provide detailed histories of forestry and salmon in the watersheds of Musgamagw Dzawadaâ€™enuxw territory, new fieldwork with which to analyze how forestry practices and history interact with climate change to affect salmon, and a quantitative analysis of salmon population responses to forestry histories across the full British Columbia coast.
