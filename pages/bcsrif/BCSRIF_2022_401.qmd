**Overview:**  
This PSF project will assist communities strive to adjust fisheries management to deal with climate change uncertainties by monitoring climate change in salmon freshwater habitats. This project will enable both local and broad scale planning for climate resilient salmon ecosystems. This will include the PSF leads working with 26 different organizations across BC including 14 First Nations' organizations to: 1) Scale-up the application of computer-vision tools to empower communities with real-time information on salmon returns that can inform proactive in-season fisheries management; 2) Harmonize community-led monitoring of salmon ecosystems by providing guidance on best practices, working with partners to implement new stream temperature and flow monitoring where there are gaps, and synthesizing and sharing data across organizations; and 3) Create opportunities for integration and collaboration among communities and projects through workshops and working groups.
