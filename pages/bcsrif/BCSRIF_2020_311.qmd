## BCSRIF Project Summary

**Species Group:** Pacific Salmon  
**Location:** Campbell River  
**Partners:** None listed

**Presentation Date(s):** December 11, 2025  
**Speakers:** Ahmed Siah  
**Abstract:**  
The recipient aims to validate Nanopore technology as a rapid and broad-range tool for detecting salmon pathogens from biological and environmental samples from hatcheries. The technology will be applied to screen broodstock examine pathogen sources and their distribution in hatchery systems and identify/characterize the agent(s) associated with disease occurrences.
