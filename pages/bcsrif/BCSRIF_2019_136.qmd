## BCSRIF Project Summary

**Species Group:** Pacific Salmon  
**Location:** Province-wide  
**Partners:** Fisheries and Oceans Canada  
**Organization:** Pacific Salmon Foundation  
**Session(s):** Fish Health  
**Presentation Date(s):** December 11, 2025  
**Speakers:** Samantha James  
**Abstract:**  
The Pacific Salmon Foundation conducted a science-based review of hatcheries in the BC to evaluate performance and effectiveness. As part of that review, four ‘omics’ technologies were evaluated for their utility in hatchery management and salmonid production: genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The review provided technical details on the use of the various tools with examples of their relevance to hatchery deliverables and was accompanies by a user-focused manual to highlight genomic applications for present day hatchery operations. A summary of their findings and recommendations will be provided.
