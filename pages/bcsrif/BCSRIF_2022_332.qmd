**Overview:**  
Huu-ay-aht First Nations will undertake work over a 3-year study period, to consider the applicability for the Sarita Chinook population as an ecological indicator for the COSEWIC listed West Vancouver Island, Ocean, Fall (South) population and the Westcoast Vancouver Island (WCVI) Management Unit. The proposed project will enumerate migration of Chinook smolts, monitor and evaluate salmon distribution, habitat use and spawning areas in the Sarita estuary and river system, consider predation impacts and study the nearshore marine habitat use and biological characteristics of Chinook Salmon in Numukamis Bay (which the Sarita River empties into) and Barkley Sound.
