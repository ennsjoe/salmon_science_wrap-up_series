**Session(s):** Fisheries Monitoring And Harvest Methods  
**Presentation Date(s):** December 09, 2025  
**Speakers:** Will Atlas  
**Abstract:**  
This project will integrate traditional and modern technologies through the development of new computer vision deep-learning programs to automate salmon counting and species identification from video and sonar data. Connecting these tools with community-run escapement monitoring programs around the North and Central Coast will support the transition towards real-time data integration and in-season monitoring to inform the adaptive management of salmon fisheries.
