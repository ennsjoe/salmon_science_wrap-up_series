How do we consider climate vulnerability and resilience to inform planning and prioritize actions?"
2,Freshwater Stressors,David Patterson,45993,"Mechanistic, physiological, and quantitative studies for evaluating stressors to freshwater habitats of Pacific salmon, including cumulative stressors.",1PM-3PM,"Pacific Science Enterprise Centre (PSEC), West Vancouver",https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/1f2df8a8-252e-47f7-8df1-a6096b1fa578@1594fdae-a1d9-4405-915d-011467234338,"What are current best approaches for understanding cumulative impacts to salmon in freshwater ecosystems?  What do these methods tell us about the current and future state of freshwater ecosystems and the implications for salmon survival?

How do stressors and cumulative effects vary across stocks, species, and geographic regions?

How do we apply our improved understanding of freshwater stressors to better manage salmon habitats?"
3,Follow the Fish,Isobel Pearsall,45995,"A review of the Follow the Fish Program, including methods and approaches for life cycle assessment of WCVI Chinook and ecosystem-scale research programs.",10AM-12PM,"Institute of Ocean Sciences (IOS), Sidney",https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/038709c6-a551-4faa-8957-8f56a8b7f32b@1594fdae-a1d9-4405-915d-011467234338,"What has been learned with respect to best practices for collaborative research?  

How has expanded life cycle monitoring informed our understanding of survival bottlenecks for WCVI Chinook?  How can these insights inform WCVI Chinook rebuilding?

What findings can be generalized to other salmon populations in the Pacific Region? Where are there gaps in our understanding that life cycle monitoring can help address to inform rebuilding and management? "
4,Marine Stressors,Cameron Freshwater,45995,Research on stressors in nearshore marine ecosystems and their effects on salmon survival.,1PM-3PM,"Institute of Ocean Sciences (IOS), Sidney",https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/038709c6-a551-4faa-8957-8f56a8b7f32b@1594fdae-a1d9-4405-915d-011467234338,"What are major sources of uncertainty when assessing marine survival of salmon?  How has our understanding improved over the last 5+ years?

What are the key marine stressors or sources of mortality for the marine life stages of Pacific salmon in Canada?  How have these stressors varied over time and across regions/species/stocks?"
5,Fisheries Monitoring and Harvest Methods,Nicholas Brown,46000,Projects piloting new methods for selective salmon harvest and informing fisheries management decisions through improved monitoring.,10AM-12PM,Virtual Only,https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/2b7462ee-b28d-4f73-b4df-4a48d954cdb3@1594fdae-a1d9-4405-915d-011467234338,"How are new fishing methods and selective gear improving sustainability and access to fishing opportunities?

How have enhanced fisheries and stock monitoring allowed us to better manage fisheries to meet conservation and harvest objectives?  

What are emerging or future challenges for sustainable fisheries management that research and monitoring can help to address?"
6,Data and Modelling to Support Decision-Making,Carrie Holt,46000,"Databases, analytic tools, and modelling projects that provide information to support decision-making for salmon conservation and management",1PM-3PM,Virtual Only,https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/2b7462ee-b28d-4f73-b4df-4a48d954cdb3@1594fdae-a1d9-4405-915d-011467234338,"How are improved data accessibility and analytic tools being used to inform decisions related to salmon management and conservation?  Where are there gaps remaining where better data availability can improve decision-making?

How can new data and analytic tools be used to help us address emerging challenges in salmon conservation and management?"
7,Hatchery Fitness and Genetics,Tim Healy,46002,"Research on the genetic and fitness consequences of hatchery enhancment, and the interactions between hatchery and wild salmon.",10AM-12PM,"Pacific Biological Station (PBS), Nanaimo",https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/b685712a-d089-4f8f-8b6a-a6b7953ff0da@1594fdae-a1d9-4405-915d-011467234338,"What are the genetic and fitness consequences of hatchery rearing on enhanced populations?  What practices can be used to minimize these consequences? 

How is new research improving our understanding of the interactions between hatcheries and wild salmon populations?  How can negative genetic impacts on wild populations be mitigated?"
