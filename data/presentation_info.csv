2422,Development and application of laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry to determine estuary entry size of juvenile salmonids and track habitat usage,"Nicole LaForge, Micah Quindazzi ","Nicole LaForge is a scientist who studies the microchemistry of biological tissues such as fish otoliths at the Institute of Ocean Sciences (IOS) for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) in Sidney, BC. She has an MSc from the University of Victoria in Developmental Biology and Embryology. Nicole has extensive experience in the preparation and analysis of samples by Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and joined DFO in 2023 to develop the use of this powerful analytical technique in-house for the Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative and beyond. The mass spectrometry laboratory at IOS has the only instrumentation capable of generating this type of high-resolution time-resolved biological data within DFO.

Micah Quindazzi is a PhD Candidate who uses microchemistry to study the migrations of Chinook and Coho salmon at IOS in Sidney, BC. Micah has comprehensive experience in the study of all topics related to the otoliths of salmonids. He has been involved in PSSI since 2021 to study the estuary entry size and marine migrations of WCVI Chinook salmon. He has worked with Nicole to develop techniques for the study of salmonid otoliths using LA-ICP-MS. He is also working on ECVI and Fraser River systems using similar techniques.",Follow the Fish,DFO,DFO,"Microchemistry of fish otoliths (calcium carbonate ear crystals) is a very useful tool for tracking habitat usage. IOS currently has the only instrumentation and expertise within DFO to carry out this type of analysis. During this project we developed a method for relating the size (fork lengths) of juvenile WCVI Chinook Salmon at estuary entry to their otolith radii, and using it to back-calculate the estuary fork lengths of returning adult spawners using Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) for PSSI priority river systems including Sarita, Robertson/Stamp and Nitinat from 2015-2023. We found that, generally, there are two types of natural origin (NO) outmigrants: those that leave the river early at small fork lengths, and those that use the river for longer and thus leave later and at larger fork lengths. In the Sarita River, these life history types emerge as Early Small NO smolts that leave the river under 50 mm between February to April, and Late Large NO smolts that leave the river above 50 mm after April. These Late Large NO smolts can survive up to 20X better than the Early Small smolts, 40% better than the hatchery origin smolts and comprise a much larger proportion of the returning spawners than would be expected considering that they represent around 5% of the outmigrants in the Sarita River system. While Late Large NO smolts survived better, the Early Small NO smolts comprised over 80% of the oldest Chinook salmon in the system. Otolith microchemistry provides a cost-effective means of gleaning information on the life histories of salmonids that can enhance our understanding and inform population rebuilding strategies, and demonstrates that NO Chinook Salmon provide significant phenotypic diversity, which would not be possible to replicate with hatchery production alone and provide a buffer against population extinction events. We conclude that there are significant carry-over effects from freshwater to the marine environment affecting WCVI Chinook entry timing and size, which may also correlate to their health.",Yes,11:15 AM,"LGL Ltd., Huu-ay-aht First Nation",NA

2546,"Same Salmon, Shared Semantics. The DFO Salmon Ontology for Data Integration and Decision Support",Brett Johnson,NA,Data and Modelling to Support Decision-Making,DFO,DFO,"Salmon decisions stall on semantics, not on science. Take “wild salmon”: locally it can mean natural-origin fish, fish spawning naturally this year (including hatchery-origin spawners), or simply adipose-intact fish—definitions that change counts and benchmarks and challenge regional analyses. This fragmentation slows management, obscures accountability, and undermines confidence in otherwise excellent science. What’s needed is a shared vocabulary and an agreed-upon map of salmon terms—clear definitions and relationships that connect local labels to common meanings so people and software interpret data the same: a shared dictionary and rulebook for salmon data, an ontology. The DFO Salmon Ontology provides that map of how terms relate, and the controlled vocabularies that underpin it supply precise definitions—showing where terms differ, how they align, and where they should converge. Together, they standardize key terms across programs and regions. Teams can map local terms once, keep source systems unchanged yet aligned regionally, and link inputs to methods, benchmarks, and policy thresholds for Fisheries Science Reports, the Fish Stock Provisions, and the Wild Salmon Policy. Developed by the Fishery & Assessment Data Section in the Pacific Region Science Branch, this work builds on the International Year of the Salmon Data Mobilization initiative and collaborations with the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (U.S.) and the global Research Data Alliance. It is open source and implements community standards from the W3C, OBO Foundry, and Darwin Core. By removing terminology friction, it prepares us for AI-assisted data integration and cross-discipline interoperability while immediately letting biologists spend less time cleaning data. Our goal is straightforward: to provide persistent, web-accessible definitions that help scientists and software combine data efficiently, support reproducible analyses, and strengthen confidence in salmon management.",Yes,2:00 PM,"Melissa Morrison, Tom Bird, Minh Doan",NA

Through two BC SRIF projects, the SWP has expanded their work to focus on the impacts of climate change on salmon and their freshwater habitats. The first project included modelling the climate change exposure of Pacific salmon Conservation Units in the Fraser River basin to understand their relative exposure to projected climate changes throughout their lifecycles. The results can be used alongside assessments of biological status and habitat degradation to strategically prioritize actions for salmon resilience. The second project was more tactical, working with numerous First Nations and other partners to implement community-led monitoring of stream temperature and flow and support the harmonization of approaches and datasets across organizations. Together, these projects shed light on how climate change impacts salmon watersheds today and into the future and provided opportunities for integration and collaboration across groups.",Yes,10:15 AM,NA,NA
