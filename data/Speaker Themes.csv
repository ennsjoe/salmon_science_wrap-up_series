2422,Follow the Fish,,"Nicole LaForge, Micah Quindazzi ","Nicole LaForge is a scientist who studies the microchemistry of biological tissues such as fish otoliths at the Institute of Ocean Sciences (IOS) for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) in Sidney, BC. She has an MSc from the University of Victoria in Developmental Biology and Embryology. Nicole has extensive experience in the preparation and analysis of samples by Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and joined DFO in 2023 to develop the use of this powerful analytical technique in-house for the Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative and beyond. The mass spectrometry laboratory at IOS has the only instrumentation capable of generating this type of high-resolution time-resolved biological data within DFO.

Micah Quindazzi is a PhD Candidate who uses microchemistry to study the migrations of Chinook and Coho salmon at IOS in Sidney, BC. Micah has comprehensive experience in the study of all topics related to the otoliths of salmonids. He has been involved in PSSI since 2021 to study the estuary entry size and marine migrations of WCVI Chinook salmon. He has worked with Nicole to develop techniques for the study of salmonid otoliths using LA-ICP-MS. He is also working on ECVI and Fraser River systems using similar techniques.",DFO,DFO,,Yes,11:15 AM

Through two BC SRIF projects, the SWP has expanded their work to focus on the impacts of climate change on salmon and their freshwater habitats. The first project included modelling the climate change exposure of Pacific salmon Conservation Units in the Fraser River basin to understand their relative exposure to projected climate changes throughout their lifecycles. The results can be used alongside assessments of biological status and habitat degradation to strategically prioritize actions for salmon resilience. The second project was more tactical, working with numerous First Nations and other partners to implement community-led monitoring of stream temperature and flow and support the harmonization of approaches and datasets across organizations. Together, these projects shed light on how climate change impacts salmon watersheds today and into the future and provided opportunities for integration and collaboration across groups.",Yes,10:15 AM
