2022-2023,2394,Enhanced salmon bycatch monitoring and sampling in the Pacific region groundfish trawl fishery,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Cory Lagasse,Approved,"### Background

The Pacific Region groundfish trawl fishery likely represents the largest source of Pacific salmon catch in a non-salmon directed commercial fishery. While all Pacific salmon species are prohibited in groundfish trawl and cannot be sold or traded, salmon bycatch in trawl fisheries experience high mortality rates and there have been no management measures in place to monitor or mitigate risks to stocks of concern. This sampling program was designed in collaboration between DFO Science, Fisheries Management, industry and monitoring service providers to provide accurate estimates of salmon bycatch by species in the trawl fishery and representative information on Chinook stock composition and indicator stocks.

### Objectives

Initial discussions led to the following four objectives being adopted to guide development of the program: 1\. Accurately estimate the catch in numbers of fish of each salmon species; 2\. Ensure sufficiently accurate and representative CWT sampling to quantify the fishery mortality for Chinook indicator stocks; 3\. Use genetic stock identification (i.e. DNA) where feasible to identify the stock composition of Chinook catch, including for populations that do not have CWT indicator stocks; and 4\. Estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of Chinook catch to determine when and where exploitation on stocks of concern may be occurring.

The program was initiated across for all option A groundfish trawl vessels in September 2022, and will be continued during the 2023/24 fiscal year.

2023-2024,2397,Identifying good practices for considering Indigenous Knowledge in Rebuilding Plan targets and stock assessment reference poi,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Modelling & Decision Support,Carrie Holt,Submitted,"The goal of this project is to identify reference points and rebuilding targets for Pacific salmon by pairing Indigenous knowledge systems with Western science within a knowledge co-production paradigm. Knowledge co-production can be defined as “the process of bringing together two different knowledge systems, in true partnership and equity, to enhance, learn, and create new understandings on a specific topic.” (Ellam Yua et al. 2022).

Analytical methods for identifying limit reference points have been developed for Pacific salmon (DFO 2022a) based on Western science, but these have not considered Indigenous Knowledge which was identified as a gap within CSAS review (DFO 2022a, b). ‘Upper stock references’ (delineating ‘critical’ and ‘cautious’ zones of status) and rebuilding targets are components of the DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework and the Fish Stocks provisions under the Fisheries Act, but guidance on identifying them is currently lacking for Pacific salmon. The Fisheries Act further enables the consideration of Indigenous Knowledge in management, such as in the development of rebuilding targets and reference points, but there is limited/no precedents for this for Pacific salmon.

Pairing Indigenous knowledge systems and Western science in the development of reference points and targets is a step towards ensuring that rebuilding is inclusive of Nations’ ontologies, including their definitions for ‘healthy’ and ‘rebuilt’. First Nations have a precedence of knowledge that includes generations of place-based observations that cannot be recreated, or necessarily measured quantitatively. This project, partnered with the Ha’oom Fisheries Society, will explore how to include this alongside or within Western science ideas of status assessment and rebuilding. Methods will be co-created with First Nations partners; we anticipate that they will include a combination of interviews, facilitated discussions, literature reviews, and meta-analyses. In particular, we will identify what levels and attributes are considered ‘healthy’ or ‘rebuilt’ for salmon populations and where ‘serious harm’ is expected to occur, including life-history, distributional, and habitat characteristics.

The project will be co-led with the Five Nations (Ahousaht, Ehattesaht, Mowachaht/Muchalaht, Hesquiaht and Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations) that are represented by the Ha’oom Fisheries Society, with a focus on relationship building and addressing Indigenous needs and values. Bringing Indigenous knowledge systems and Western science together will lead to more equitable and inclusive outcomes, supporting the aims of reconciliation and furthering the capacity for Indigenous self governance. Achieving sustainability of salmon fisheries cannot be achieved through a Western scientific lens alone; incorporating Indigenous Knowledge Systems and a broader perspective on what is considered healthy and serious harm in salmon ecosystems will be essential. The costs in year 1 will be supported in part by Five Nations Funding through DFO’s Treaties and Reconciliation Agreements Program.

2023-2024,2398,WCVI Sediment Transport and Redd Scour Assessment,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Diana McHugh,Submitted,"  1. West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschwatcha) populations declined precipitously after the 1990s. Survival rates for naturally spawning WCVI Chinook are now below replacement levels. In 2020, WCVI Chinook was listed as ""Threatened"" by Canada's Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife triggering the Chinook Rebuilding Plan and the marine and freshwater risk assessment (FWRA) processes. Results from the FWRA, highlighted that across the region the incubation life history phase was extremely data deficient. High incubation mortality can reduce productivity and limit the recovery of Chinook salmon populations. A small change in survival during this life history phase can have significant implications on production. Redd scour was identified as a high priority data gap in the indicator watersheds throughout WCVI. The purpose of this study is to evaluate redd scour, sediment transport, and hydrological conditions in three indicator watersheds in Area 23 and Area 24. This study will be important for developing a standard methodology to address this data gap, and for characterizing the scale of the issue. The results will be vital for developing indicators and benchmarks, and to inform restoration, enhancement, and rebuilding measures for WCVI Chinook.

  2. The outcomes of the redd scour study are to: A. Develop a robust methodology to measure redd scour that can be repeated in indicator watersheds across the region; B. Estimate what percentage of redds are scoured at different flow thresholds and how that impacts salmonid mortality during incubation; and, C. Understand what effect more frequent and higher peak flows in a changing climate will have on redd scour and salmonid mortality in the future.

The methodology for the study has three components: I. The installation of a hydrometric station that is calibrated to provide a continuous discharge record for Tranquil Creek and implement a pilot methodology in Tranquil Creek (completed 2022). II. Field surveys in spawning locations that includes cross-sections and sediment size measurements, and the installation of PIT tagged accelerometer scour chains at surveyed locations to measure redd scour; (planned for Sarita [externally funded] and Tranquil in 2023 and Bedwell 2024). III. Pairing bed disturbance data with a 2D hydraulic model to estimate the spatial extent of bed disturbance at a reach scale in key Chinook and chum spawning areas. (Planned for 2023 in Sarita [externally funded] and 2024 Bedwell).

  1. The results from this study will be important for characterizing the scale of the issue and will be vital for developing restoration prescriptions and can inform indicator development, enhancement, and rebuilding strategies in the region. In particular, for the Bedwell and Sarita Rivers, a rotary screw trap provides a total abundance estimate, which facilities that calculation of the egg-fry survival rate. Developing a relationship between over-winter egg-fry survival and redd scour and sediment movement, will be important for understanding the scale of the issue in watersheds across WVCI and the urgency needed to address this issue.

2023-2024,2399,Risk Assessment Method for Salmon – Development for Regional Implementation,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Modelling & Decision Support,Chrissy Czembor,Approved,"**(1) WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED**

Hyatt et al. developed the Risk Assessment Method for Salmon (RAMS) in 2010 to identify and prioritize factors that limit salmon production, both now and under climate change. It was adapted from existing DFO risk assessment frameworks and a risk assessment framework for fisheries in Australia, and provides a standardized and semi-quantitative method to integrate ecosystem data and expert opinion related to salmon survival across all their life stages. The resulting list of ranked risks identifies both high priority management needs and data gaps that require additional investigation.

RAMS has been applied in more than a half dozen watersheds for Chinook (ocean and stream type), coho, and sockeye to inform Recovery Potential Assessments under the Species at Risk Act and Rebuilding Plans under the Fish Stock Provisions of the Fisheries Act. RAMS continues to evolve toward a standard methodology flexible enough to assess risks at different scales and with various levels of data availability. Included in those methods are: Regional Salmon Information Tables that provide scientific information about freshwater limiting factors for all major life history strategies of Pacific salmon species; a deterministic Life History Model template completed using relevant population data; an Ecosystem (Habitat) Status Report template completed using existing habitat and ecosystem information; and a Risk Assessment Matrix template completed during a RAMS workshop, currently in Excel format.

Areas of improvement for RAMS have been identified to facilitate regional implementation. Several components will be addressed by the existing project team, but some are beyond the capacity and/or expertise of the team and are the purpose of this proposed work. These include: (A) updates to the Regional Salmon Information Tables. This resource has not been updated since inception and significant new science is available to maintain relevance. Inclusion of marine information is also necessary to understand the bottlenecks to salmon across all their life stages. And (B) a conversion from the Excel-based Risk Assessment Matrix template to an R program based on a relational database with an interactive user interface. The Excel-based template is functional but does not allow for visualization of the many ecosystem components that are aggregated to understand risk; complex analysis of relationships between indicators and limiting factors; or hierarchical meta-analyses of data gaps and risk across stocks to facilitate prioritization of monitoring and research. Conversion to a relational database with a user interface will allow for this functionality.

__(2) OUTCOMES: __

A updated, robust RAMS framework applicable for all salmon species structured for continuous learning and updating, that is user-friendly for DFO and non-DFO technical staff. Specifically, 1\. Updated Regional Salmon Information Tables by life stage and ecosystem unit, including indicators, benchmarks, and guidance for RAMS facilitators. Request is for two BI-02s to update through existing literature and engage with DFO and other scientists (e.g., Dr. Jonathon Moore’s lab at SFU, Institute of Ocean Sciences oceanographers) to facilitate addition of freshwater and marine indicators and information. The team will pilot the tables for use in rebuilding and recovery processes and update as needed. 2\. Updated Risk Assessment Matrix template from Excel to an R-based program and backend database. This will require specialized coding expertise either through hiring or contract.  
3\. Workshop(s) with relevant DFO staff will be used to scope the structure and functionality required. 4\. Updates to the RAMS methodology and support work will require 0.35 FTE (Full Time Equivalents) for a BI-03.

**(3) THE MANAGEMENT QUESTION(S) ADDRESSED**

RAMS will prioritize risks to salmon stocks across the 3 Hs of Habitat, Harvest, and Hatcheries by identifying management and mitigation options most likely to result in successful restoration and rebuilding, which will support decision making in each of the 3Hs. It will prioritize scientific research and monitoring to address key knowledge gaps and integrate knowledge across disciplines inside and outside DFO. RAMS will support and standardize the legislated requirements for rebuilding plans under the Fish Stock Provisions and Recovery Potential Assessments under SARA.

Infection with this bacterial pathogen can result in significant morbidity and mortality in cultured juvenile Pacific salmon most notably Chinook salmon. The current strategy for disease avoidance is screening brood stock to exclude eggs from highly infected brood females using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a predetermined positive-negative threshold optical density value. The current guidelines for control of BKD have significantly reduced the incidence of disease in both hatchery-reared juveniles and returning adult fish.

The Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP) has 16 years of ELISA data for many Vancouver Island and mainland Coho and Chinook stocks, providing thirteen 3-year cycle for Chinook and fourteen 3-year cycle for Coho salmon. In addition, SEP also has direct fluorescent antibody technique (DFAT) semi-quantitative prevalence pre-release data for many of the stocks with ELISA broodstock data. Epidemiological analysis of this data will provide valuable information for identification of potential explanatory variables for BKD prevalence in stocks of concern. Furthermore, the ELISA database can be linked to the Parental Based Tagging (PBT) database.

The objectives of this project are as follows: \- Analysis of the ELISA data to identify potential explanatory variables and magnitude of effect as hatchery level management measures. \- Use simulation to model effect of increasing the positive-negative culling threshold optical density value \- Analysis of the DFAT prevalence for yearling stocks prior to release to identify potential predictor variables. \- Link PBT data with ELISA data analysis from the first objective.

2023-2024,2401,Epidemiological modeling of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus in Sockeye salmon,PSSI (B-base),Aquatic Animal Health,Kyle Garver,Approved,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a deadly virus of sockeye salmon, causing catastrophic losses during the early lifestages (1-4). Long-term monitoring of IHNV infections across multiple stocks of sockeye salmon has revealed the prevalence of IHNV infections can vary annually within and between stocks; however, the factor(s) responsible for such fluctuations in IHNV prevalence in sockeye salmon stocks in British Columbia remain unresolved. Understanding the drivers behind the occurrence and perpetuation of IHNV in Sockeye salmon is instrumental in managing and mitigating the risk of this endemic pathogen.

Building upon work conducted through the Program for Aquaculture Regulatory Research, we’ll utilize epidemiological analytical approaches to study the patterns of IHNV occurrence across Fraser, Skeena and Columbia River Sockeye salmon stocks with the goal of identifying the factors which influence IHNV infection and disease in BC Sockeye salmon stocks. This will be achieved through three main objectives accomplished over a two year period: Objective 1: (Year 1) – Expand upon a long-term dataset of IHNV in Fraser and Skeena Sockeye stocks to include IHNV monitoring results of Okanagan River Sockeye salmon. In addition this comprehensive IHNV dataset will be populated with data detailing the enumeration of fish at various life stages, survival rates, and productivity for each of the corresponding Sockeye stocks. Where available, data concerning environmental and other potentially important variables gathered from other databases will be integrated into the new database to explore how these variables may impact pathogen prevalence.

Objective 2: (Year 1& 2) – Data verification and analyses to compare IHNV prevalence across the multiple Sockeye salmon stocks, evaluating similarities and differences both within and between stocks along with temporal and spatial variation.

Objective 3: (Year 2 & 3) – Use a mixed-effects analysis and ecosystem health approach to determine how changes in pathogen prevalence in wild sockeye populations relate to environmental and other potentially important factors and management measures in an effort to identify potential correlates with IHNV variability.

This work will permit a data-based logical argument enabling one to quantify specific environmental or other variable affects on IHNV status and facilitate the development and implementation of management measures to mitigate effects of IHNV in hatchery and enhanced populations of Sockeye salmon.

2023-2024,2402,Quantifying Yukon Chinook migration mortality and its implications for fisheries management and rebuilding under the Fish Stock Provisions of the Fisheries Act,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,"Brendan Connors, Adam O'Dell",Submitted,"Yukon River Chinook salmon have experienced declines in returns in recent decades culminating in four of the lowest returns on record in 2020-2023. These declines have put immense strain on the subsistence communities and Fish Nations that historically depended upon Chinook salmon throughout the Yukon River. They have also impacted the ability of the United States and Canada to meet escapement goals under the Pacific Salmon Treaty’s Yukon River Agreement, and are likely to have resulted in the Stock Management Unit, which is scheduled to be prescribed by regulation under the amended Fisheries Act in 2023/2024, to fall below its Limit Reference Point. In recent years large numbers (33%-52%) of returning Canadian-origin Chinook salmon have gone “missing” between sonar assessments at the mouth of the Yukon River and ~2000 km upriver at the border between Alaska and Canada. This has severely undermined the efficacy of fisheries management measures within the Alaskan portion of the river. A leading hypothesis for these missing fish is en route mortality due to heat stress (JTC 2020), which has been documented along with opportunistic observation of premature mortalities in Yukon River Chinook Salmon when spawning migration water temperatures exceed 18°C (Biela et al. 2020; 2022). However, direct estimates of en route mortality do not exist and a recent CSAS regional peer review (DFO 2022) identified the drivers and magnitude of en route mortality, and their consequences for management advice, as a critical uncertainty.

We propose to carry out a 3 year radio-telemetry project to quantify en route mortality of Yukon Chinook in relation to freshwater environmental conditions along their up to ~3000km migration from the mouth of the Yukon river to headwater spawning grounds. We will then use these estimates of en route mortality to evaluate the sustainability of the current aggregate escapement goal for Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook, and rebuilding potential of component Conservation Units (Connors et al. 2022) to inform analyses to meet the Fish Stock Provisions of the revised Fisheries Act for the Stock Management Unit. We are specifically seeking funding to extend radio-tracking infrastructure (towers and aerial overflights) into Canada to take advantage of an Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) project that will tag and track ~600 Chinook salmon in the Alaskan Portion of the Yukon River.

The management question being addressed by this project is: what is the magnitude of en route mortality in Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook and what are its consequences for international and domestic fisheries management, rebuilding potential, and integrated planning.

The specific outcomes of this project include:

  1. estimates of migration speed, timing, and en route mortality of Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook, by Conservation Unit and river section, in relation to freshwater environmental conditions; and

  2. quantitative evaluation of the consequences of a range of en route mortality (based on study) for the sustainability of alternative aggregate escapement goals and rebuilding potential.

2023-2024,2403,San Juan River Adult and Juvenile Assessment Program,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Katie Davidson,Submitted,"The San Juan River is major watershed in southwest Vancouver Island (near Port Renfrew, BC) that supports distinct populations of Chinook, Coho and Chum, with Chinook enhanced annually at the 4 Mile Hatchery. The San Juan River empties into Port San Juan (PFMA 20-2).

Pacheedaht First Nation’s Salmon Stewardship Program conducts monitoring and restoration work in the San Juan-Gordon watersheds and estuary. Their work spans the salmon lifecycle and includes investigating impacts of redd scour on egg-to-fry survival, documenting juvenile salmon habitat use in the estuary, and conducting adult spawner surveys. Recently, they have also launched a pilot Chinook marking program with the 4 Mile Hatchery to reduce the impacts of hatchery genetics on the wild Chinook population through selective removals of adipose-clipped Chinook in terminal fisheries.

These activities will all inform the San Juan Chinook Rebuilding Plan in development by PFN, which will be linked to the broader WCVI Chinook Rebuilding Plan in development by DFO (required under the Fish Stock Provisions Act for naturally-produced WCVI Chinook, due March 2024) (DFO 2022; Minister of Justice 2022). However, the recent WCVI Chinook Risk Assessment process identified several knowledge gaps, mostly related to early freshwater and marine life cycle stages. For San Juan Chinook specifically, juvenile data from these life stages (and interactions between hatchery and wild juveniles) are sparse, and biological data on natural spawners (e.g., age, origin) are limited for Chinook.

These reasons make the San Juan River a good candidate to continue developing an integrated life history monitoring program in alignment with the larger Follow The Fish program. We propose to focus on the key work activities identified in Years 1 and 2 of the program, specifically those that complement Pacheedaht’s established juvenile monitoring programs. First, we will continue the rotary screw trap program to enumerate and sample naturally-produced out-migrating juveniles (all species, but focused on juvenile Chinook migration timing), allowing us to compare natural migration timing to hatchery release timing and to gather baseline biological traits relative to hatchery releases (e.g., size, condition). Otolith and stomach samples are also collected from a sub-sample of individuals to assess size-specific survival and diet contents. In Year 2 (2024), we developed a mark-recapture to obtain a relative abundance estimate for naturally-produced juvenile Chinook, and plan to implement this more thoroughly in Year 3 (2025). Second, we will conduct biweekly purse seining in Port San Juan through the late spring, summer and fall months (~May-October) to collect mixed-stock information, including hatchery/natural-origin of juvenile Chinook, stock ID, biological traits, relative abundance, and information on other species schooling with Chinook (e.g., Coho, Pacific Herring). As with the RST program, we will also be collecting otoliths and stomach contents from a sub-sample of Chinook encountered. Finally, we would like to develop a biosampling plan for naturally-spawning Chinook. We currently rely completely on broodstock sampling to assess adult spawner age and origin, but need to collect samples from natural spawners as well to ensure broodstock samples are not introducing any age- or stock-specific biases. This is critical for monitoring the Proportion of Natural Influence (PNI) for San Juan Chinook and to have an accurate representation of age-at-return to assess productivity trends.

We focus on Chinook due to the reasons mentioned previously (e.g., Rebuilding Plans) and for linkages to other programs currently funded under PSSI Pillar 1.1 such as Follow The Fish (DM Apps Project ID 2407), Ecological Indicators (DM Apps Project ID 2414) and Redd Scour Work (DM Apps Project ID 2398). The budget for Year 3 reflects costs for expanding the core field activities from Years 1 and 2, such as longer RST and purse seine seasons based on Year 2 Chinook catch results. Sample processing is also a key focus of Year 3, and the budget reflects the need to process biological samples such as genetics and stomach contents. It also includes technician time to support not only San Juan work but also Ecological Indicators and occasionally Follow The Fish (we plan to share technician resources among all projects as much as possible). Continued technician support is critical in order to meet reporting deadlines for PSSI Pillar 1.1.

By combining these key activities with PFN’s existing programs, we can obtain information from almost all stages of the Chinook life cycle, from adults to eggs to early marine juveniles. PFN employ a team of highly skilled technicians and biologists, and are well placed to eventually lead much of this work in future following this brief period of investment, capacity building, and project development supported by DFO.

2023-2024,2404,"Improving baseline knowledge of environmental conditions in Vancouver Islands fjords through observations and modelling, with a focus on hypoxia dynamics, climate change, and the potential implications for Pacific salmon",PSSI (B-base),Climate Change and Oceans,Laura Bianucci,Submitted,"This project supports ongoing observational and modelling work in the fjords of the west coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI), with the goal of better understanding oxygen dynamics in this region. Modelling work started in fiscal year 2021-22 and main deliverables (a coupled physical-biogeochemical model of WCVI, south of Kyuquot) are expected by the end of 2023-24. A small observational component started during 2021-22 and has grown in scope every year. Through PSSI, we have two main goals: to create a monitoring program for Clayoquot Sound in 2023-24 (that will ideally extend to 2025-26) and to support and extend modelling efforts in the WCVI.

Specifically, we propose the following: a. Establish a Clayoquot Sound Monitoring Program in collaboration with the local First Nations (FN) and other organizations (Hakai Institute and Nature Trust of BC). Talks with all involved parties started in 2022-23; the plan is to provide training and equipment to the FN so they can use their vessels to perform monthly conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sampling throughout Clayoquot Sound (45 stations). These observations will support ongoing modelling work and will provide an important baseline of environmental conditions (including oxygen) throughout the year. This baseline is needed to understand the present-day environment experienced by migrating Pacific salmon. Without this baseline, it will be difficult to assess the effects of climate change in salmon populations and migrating routes.

b. Hire a term PC3 to contribute to the progress of the coupled physical-biogeochemical model for the west coast of Vancouver Island. In particular, this PC3 will lead the simulation of future scenarios and will act as a liaison with salmon experts, to ensure that the outputs of our simulations are useful for population distribution modelling and other salmon-related projections.

c. Hire a term EG4 to contribute towards DFO-led fieldwork in the WCVI inlets as well as data processing and management. For instance, technical support is needed for the development/improvement of weather stations and the maintenance of the weather station network (their data are crucial for forcing the surface of coastal ocean models), as well as for support with mooring deployment/servicing and opportunistic CTD sampling (e.g., while servicing weather stations). Furthermore, the EG4 will be needed to manage the inflow of data from the Clayoquot Sound Monitoring Program.

Management questions: Near-surface hypoxia (as shallow as 12 m) has been recently identified in Herbert Inlet, Clayoquot Sound (Rosen et al., 2022, doi:10.3389/fmars.2022.1000041). The historical record in the region is sparse, but it suggests that shallow hypoxia is found occasionally in this inlet. Are salmon runs affected by low-oxygen conditions near the surface in the fjords? Do these shallow hypoxic events constrain/restrict salmon habitat during their migration? Are these shallow hypoxic events increasing in frequency or can they be predicted in any way? (e.g., more common during marine heat waves or during positive/negative ENSO years, etc.). In order to address these questions, as well as the more generic question “What is the environment that salmon encounter during their migration into and out of the rivers, i.e. while they swim through fjords?”, we need to establish a monitoring program throughout the fjords of interest. A consistent sampling program in the next few years will create the baseline from which we will be able to assess future changes; and a monitoring program that continues in the future will make sure we can identify any climate-related change in the fjords’ environment. Furthermore, by combining observations and high-resolution (tens of meters) ocean models, we will be able to understand the mechanisms that drive oxygen (and other – e.g., acidification) conditions in the inlets, and predict how these will be impacted by a changing climate. The modelling work proposed here for the WCVI will allow for the first study of the impacts of future conditions in these fjords.

2023-2024,2405,Biological models to support prioritizing salmon stocks under future climates,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Modelling & Decision Support,"Brendan Connors, Cameron Freshwater, Josephine Iacarella, Patrick Thompson",Submitted,"There is widespread recognition that Pacific salmon populations will be heavily impacted by climate change. These impacts are, however, expected to vary in space and time as well as across species and life stages. As a result, quantifying stock-specific risks of environmental change is critical for prioritizing DFO management actions. We propose to develop a data-driven analytical framework to quantify functional responses to climate variables across the salmon life cycle and make projections for how stocks will respond to climate change. Our approach will be sufficiently flexible to incorporate information from stocks that span a broad range of data quality.

Our multi-year proposal involves two components: In component 1, we will pair existing data on Pacific salmon population dynamics with readily available freshwater and marine environmental data to estimate the effect of variables such as temperature, flow, and food availability on salmon productivity (e.g. recruits per spawner). We will quantify life stage-specific effects on survival for stocks, including those with estimates of both juvenile and adult abundance. The focal stocks for initial modeling of data-rich stocks will be determined in year 1, with the goal of including stocks representing different species, geographic areas and status assessments relative to Wild Salmon Policy benchmarks. Ultimately, we will develop a hierarchical modeling framework which will allow us to leverage relationships in data-rich systems to estimate effects on data-limited stocks. In component 2, we will couple this modelling framework with downscaled climate models to project stock-specific responses under future climate scenarios. The projected biological status of different stocks, and associated uncertainty in them, will provide a scientifically defensible foundation upon which management interventions can be prioritized.

We are requesting funds to hire two term Research Scientists to develop the modelling framework. We expect that if only one RES were funded (or one RES and a BI2) that they could develop an initial model and demonstrate its application to a small number of case studies. However, to achieve the goal of developing a data-driven framework that is ready to be applied to stocks throughout the Pacific region, including those with medium or low data availability, two RES positions are necessary. Although the two researchers would work collaboratively, one position is focused on fitting models to estimate functional relationships for data-rich stock while the other will use simulations to develop methods for leveraging information from data-rich stocks to data-poor and provide decision criteria for broader implementation.

Such a change is thought to have occurred in Puget Sound, with negative effects on the early marine survival of juvenile salmon. The proposed collaboration, involving a geochemical oceanographer (SJ) and biological oceanographers from Canada (AS) and the United States (CK), will permit a multidisciplinary approach to the research question. The project leverages existing samples, data and monitoring programs. It combines data from new and existing sediment and seawater samples with a trend analysis of archived taxonomic data. It will expand the geographic and temporal overage of existing data, while adding new biomarker analysis (sterols and fatty acids). It is crucial for managers to understand the causes of trends and variability in salmon populations in order to set catch limits. This project will determine whether a change in primary productivity (“carrying capacity”) could be responsible for observed long-term declines in some species of salmon.

2023-2024,2407,Follow the Fish: An integrated Chinook salmon assessment and monitoring program for the West Coast of Vancouver Island,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,"Jessy Bokvist, mackenzie bartlett",Submitted,"Follow the Fish (FtF), is an overarching research program being developed to provide urgently needed information for effective conservation and rebuilding of West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook salmon populations. WCVI Chinook are listed under bill C-68 and are threatened by local extinction and poor marine survival, with high mortality thought to occur during the early marine phase. Through the recent multi-stakeholder WCVI Chinook Salmon Marine Risk Assessment (MRA) process multiple data gaps were identified for potential factors that contribute to poor early marine survival. Many salmon surveys have been conducted over the years, but few have been able to access shallower areas within the sounds off the West Coast, where ocean-type Chinook may reside for up to their first year at sea. Characterizing environmental variables of these nearshore ecosystems in addition to the health and condition of residing Chinook salmon is critical to understanding which factors may be limiting survival. To address data gaps, in 2020 a highly collaborative assessment program in nearshore areas within Sounds on the WCVI was piloted to capture juvenile Chinook salmon in their first winter at sea using microtrolling technology. Building on the successful implementation and collaboration in this program, FtF aims to expand the assessment and monitoring of WCVI Chinook both spatially and temporally to track fish throughout their first year of life and identify limiting factors related to growth and size-specific survival. The FtF program will focus on assessing Chinook salmon originating from Stamp River, Sarita River and Nitinat River populations in Barkley Sound as indicators of WCVI Chinook. Stamp River is an existing indicator for WCVI Chinook, and existing programs and infrastructure can enable relatively high rates of juvenile captures across the early marine phase. Previous microtrolling efforts have demonstrated these populations are detected in nearshore areas throughout WCVI Sounds over the winter through capture of hatchery and wild fish. Although these populations are predominately hatchery origin fish, contrasts will be made, where possible, between wild and hatchery fish to understand how factors limiting survival and growth may differ. Salmon will be captured at multiple time points throughout their life cycle including in the Nitinat River Hatchery and Robertson Creek Hatchery, in-river (rotary screw trap and/or beach seining), in estuary (beach seining/purse seining), and in nearshore marine environments (purse seining/microtrolling). At each time point, individual fish will be sampled to assess health and condition (infectious agents, Fit-Chip gene expression profiles, stomach contents, contaminants, lengths, weights, and clinical signs) and stock of origin, paired with environmental data including physical oceanography (temperature, oxygen, pH salinity, fluorescence) and biological oceanography (chlorophyl, zooplankton). Scale samples from individual fish will be used to compare relative rates of growth, based on circulus spacing, across life stages and populations to assess the impact of health, condition and environmental factors. Otolith samples taken concurrently will be used to assess relative size-specific survival across time points and populations. This can be achieved by characterizing the fork length to otolith radius relationship for smolts at ocean entry and then using otolith microchemistry for individuals who survive to subsequent time points. Broad distributional trends in how WCVI Chinook migrate will be investigated with microtrolling by capturing Northward migrating Barkley origin fish in Clayoquot, Nootka, Kyuquot and Quatsino Sound. Chinook intercepted during microtrolling that are not of Sarita, Stamp or Nitinat origin will be similarly sampled for comparisons. Many current departmental research programs are collecting datasets on salmon populations and their ecosystems that can be incorporated into the FtF program for a comprehensive assessment of factors limiting survival of WCVI Chinook. FtF is in discussion and working alongside both internal and external collaborators to ensure datasets are integrated into FtF (see project linkages). Existing DFO datasets from researchers across branches will be synthesized alongside relevant datasets produced by external collaborators. Throughout our FtF project timeline, we aim to incorporate relevant datasets through new collaborations and outreach. This approach will highlight data gaps that are not currently being addressed through either departmental or external research groups and future research avenues. Data outputs from this program will directly contribute to the WCVI Chinook rebuilding plans and will be distributed across to project collaborators for use in their programs. Knowledge on differential size-specific survival both across the early marine phase and between wild and hatchery stocks will have impacts on SEP management decisions for hatcheries and may inform harvest strategies for WCVI Chinook populations. Characterizing differential growth across the early marine phase will have important implications for restoration activities (e.g., limited prey availability) and stock management e.g., (mitigating impacts on periods and areas of critical growth). Overall, data outputs can be incorporated into pre-season and in-season forecasting and other WCVI Chinook models.

2023-2024,2409,Convergent tracks: a tagging study to quantify salmon predation by sea lions,PSSI (B-base),Pinnipeds,"Strahan Tucker, Cameron Freshwater",Submitted,"The abundance of many Pacific salmon populations has remained below management reference points for decades despite large reductions in exploitation rates. A common paradigm is that poor marine survival has constrained recovery; however, the mechanisms (e.g. predation vs. starvation) leading to mortality and at which life stages they operate remain unclear. One specific hypothesis is that large aggregations of Steller sea lions intercept Fraser River sockeye salmon (10 of 24 CUs threatened or endangered (COSEWIC 2017)) north of Vancouver Island during return migrations. Yet little is known about sea lion foraging behaviour and diet in these remote transitions zones between offshore and coastal areas and even less is known about salmon mortality rates. Our proposal outlines a field program to addresses salmon and pinniped components simultaneously. This work will employ leading edge technologies to generate hard data on sources of salmon mortality and specifically the degree of pinniped mortality, moving us/debate/issue beyond the realm of conjecture and inference. Although this document describes a sockeye salmon-sea lion field program, we emphasize that our proposal is modular in that one or both species components can be pursued, and the framework could focus on alternative pinniped species, salmon species or salmon life stages based on departmental priorities (e.g. harbor seal impacts on juvenile Chinook salmon); however the costs associated with tagging juvenile salmonids will be considerably higher.

We will estimate sea lion predation on adult sockeye salmon as they migrate past Triangle Island, off the northern tip of Vancouver Island. This region is the site of the largest Steller sea lion rookery in the world and is hypothesized to be a survival bottleneck that disproportionately impacts Fraser River sockeye salmon productivity (e.g. Walters et al. 2020). Salmon-related work would quantify predation impacts via multiple complementary tagging technologies. After capturing sockeye salmon via purse seine near Haida Gwaii, we will use satellite tags to quantify guild-specific predation rates (e.g. cetacean, pinniped, shark) based on depth and temperature sensors, to generate high resolution estimates of salmon habitat use, and to estimate diversion rates that may moderate predation impacts (i.e. migrations through Juan de Fuca rather than Johnstone Strait). We will leverage existing acoustic telemetry infrastructure in the northern Strait of Georgia, that will increase the precision of mortality rate estimates at relatively low cost. Pinniped-related work will include complementary methods (fatty acids, stable isotopes and scats) to estimate diets at multiple temporal scales along migration pathways on either side of Vancouver Island. Pinniped diet analyses will be complemented by satellite tagging to understand movements, distribution and foraging behaviour in relation to salmon mortality locations. We wish to emphasize that these pinniped data will be highly relevant for gauging predator impacts more broadly, Including other PSSI initiatives.

For the salmon component, Y1 (FY 2023-24) will be a ramp-up period, with tagging occurring in Y2 and Y3. For the pinniped component, diet collections will begin in Y1 and continue through Y3. We will undertake initial satellite tagging of pinnipeds in Y1 to refine effective protocols and increase tagging rates in Y2 and Y3. Analytical pipelines for both components will be developed in Y2 so that final analyses can begin in Y3 and continue through 2026 (PIs have the capacity to complete analytical work without additional staffing). Unfortunately salmon tagging will occur during off cycle years; however we anticipate sufficient numbers of fish will be available to meet our sample size requirements.

Ultimately data on survival rates and predation are critical to several management questions. First, total survival rates can provide strategic information on whether specific life history stages are likely to constrain recovery (i.e. if survival is high then subsequent efforts should focus on other stages). Second, information on guild-specific predation rates can provide information on the utility of targeted management actions (e.g. fisheries, culls). These data are also key inputs to ongoing life cycle and ecosystem modeling efforts intended to guide prioritization of Pacific salmon stocks for rebuilding.

2023-2024,2410,Improved decision making for salmon by understanding the threats of freshwater Aquatic Invasive Species both now and in the future,PSSI (B-base),Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS),"Thomas Therriault, Cher LaCoste",Approved,"Climate change and Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) are leading threats to biodiversity globally. In British Columbia (BC), many salmon stocks have been assessed as at-risk by COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada), but while climate change has been increasingly considered in salmon management and policy, the threat posed by AIS has largely been ignored. Further, stressors like increasing global temperatures are out of the control of regional management while AIS can be managed locally. By targeting AIS most likely to have the biggest impact on salmon survival or productivity, we can improve salmon recovery by reducing the stress that these invasive species cause. AIS impacts on salmon are well documented in the US Pacific Northwest where, for example, invasive Walleye consume up to 2 million smolts a year in the Columbia River (Sanderson et al. 2009). The expansion of Northern Pike in Alaska has led to the decline of salmon productivity in some regions and all five salmon species have been classified as highly vulnerable to pike invasion in at least part of their Alaskan range (Jalbert et al. 2021). Habitat alteration can also impact salmon: Schwoerer et al. (2019) estimated the potential for $159 million annual damage to the Alaskan Sockeye salmon industry from one invasive plant species, Elodea. However, the extent and relative impact of freshwater AIS threats to salmon habitat and productivity have yet to be assessed in BC. Here we will fill this gap.

The first step in large scale screening level risk assessments for AIS is to identify those species that could arrive in the risk assessment area and cause impacts – generating a “Master List”.  Thus, using freshwater ecoregions in Pacific Region (5) we will identify potential higher risk AIS for assessment including diseases and pathogens (e.g., whirling disease), species that are not yet present (e.g., zebra/quagga mussels), those expanding their range (e.g., bass), and those that have been established for some time (e.g., brook trout). In Year 1 we identified about 440 species that are in/near British Columbia. Further, there are over 1300 AIS in pathways such as organisms in trade that have the potential to be introduced to BC, many of which threaten salmon production. Finally, climate change will make parts of British Columbia more favorable for many of the identified invasive species and so will be incorporated into our assessments.

The identification of higher risk AIS is essential to refine other PSSI-related assessments of the multiple, often interacting threats to various Pacific salmon stocks.  This project will produce a ranked list of AIS by freshwater ecoregion, will identify key vectors and pathways, and AIS-specific impacts to freshwater ecosystems and salmon stocks specifically.  Such information can be used to refine estimates of salmon mortality, recovery or productivity thus improving fisheries management for salmon.  Further, the ranked list of AIS generated through these assessments will inform AIS monitoring and early detection programs both within DFO (AIS NCP), the Province of British Columbia (BC MOE) and the Yukon.

These acute stressor events are predicted to increase in both duration and frequency due to climate change (Frölicher et al., 2018). The proposed project will examine the impacts of warming and upwelling events (with acidified water) on the nutritional status of Limacina helicina, a cold-water pteropod that serves as an important dietary item for juvenile Pacific salmon species in the Northern Pacific (Brodeur et al., 2007; Doubleday & Hopcroft, 2015; Sturdevant et al., 2012). For example, dietary analyses of juvenile pink salmon and sockeye salmon within the Gulf of Alaska have shown a predominance of L. helicina (Brodeur et al., 2007; Doubleday & Hopcroft, 2015; Sturdevant et al., 2012). Research has demonstrated that shell development, growth, and survival of L. helicina are all highly susceptible to warming and ocean acidification (Manno et al., 2017), but there has been limited investigation of impacts to pteropod nutritional quality (i.e. composition) under the context of acute stressor events. Prey nutritional quality is a key aspect of feeding ecology that directly contributes to the survival of higher trophic species (Ahlgren et al., 2005; Daly et al., 2010). In salmon, variation in invertebrate prey quantity and quality may influence growth and survival, especially during early marine residence (Litz et al., 2019). Altered dietary lipid levels, for example, have been linked to changes in fish growth, fat deposition, and digestive enzyme activity (Pelusio et al., 2021). Consequently, we propose that any change in the nutritive status of L. helicina under climate stressor conditions could have carry-over impacts to juvenile salmon growth, health, and survival.

Following, nutritional analyses of total available lipids, storage lipid classes (e.g. phospholipids, diacylglycerol ethers), and poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) compositions of L. helicina will be carried out. 

Field assessment: L. helicina samples will be collected from field cruises on a monthly basis for ~6 months (depending on availability of field cruises and pteropods from those cruises) for assessment of seasonal changes in nutritional quality. Nutritional analyses will be carried out as described above. Results will be correlated with physical monitoring data (e.g. temperature, pH) to investigate how seawater conditions may alter nutritional status of L. helicina. We are particularly interested in the impact of acute stressor events (e.g. heatwaves, upwellings) on nutritional composition and thus will carry out additional opportunistic samplings following such events in order to examine the timing and magnitude of effect.  

*Note: Experimental exposure time is limited by the length of time the species has been able to be held under previous laboratory conditions (Busch et al., 2014; Mackas & Galbraith, 2012). If we can keep them alive for longer, then the experimental duration will be increased.

Note: If differences between treatments are detected, the current proposal could be followed-up with laboratory-based salmon feeding trials to determine whether (and to what extent) impacts to pteropods relay to juvenile salmon growth/health (e.g. multi-trophic impacts).",,No,,,Yes,Field data collected as part of Chrys Neville's Salish Sea trawl survey (Franklin).,Yes,Field data collected as part of Chrys Neville's Salish Sea trawl survey (Franklin).,,Plankton nets to collect the pteropods.,Chrys Neville,No,,Yes,"• Laboratory monitoring data and experimental data will be collected at PBS (Mackenzie).

Multiple species designated as either ""Endangered"" or ""Special Concern"" use the productive waters of Barkley Sound and adjacent shelf for all or part of their life histories. Zooplankton are a foundational component of the area's marine food webs, with the zooplankton taxon known as ""krill"" or ""euphausiids"" of critical importance for the survival of several SARA-listed species including chinook. Thus, the fortunes of krill populations are inextricably tied to those of the taxa that depend on them. This proposal aims to build on previous studies in the region to take a deep dive into the status and interannual trends of krill populations and examine how ocean conditions influence interannual trends and the seasonal cycle of krill distribution and abundance. Armed with an improved awareness of the dynamics of krill populations, we will better be able to anticipate and adapt to the associated variation of the taxa that depend on them. Generally speaking, our work aims to fill the knowledge gap regarding krill as an important prey item for juvenile salmon in both Barkley and Clayoquot Sounds.

2023-2024,2415,A Decision Support Framework for Identifying and Characterizing the Non-fishing Threats to Pacific Salmon,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Modelling & Decision Support,"Thomas Therriault, Cher LaCoste",Approved,"There is little doubt that commercial, recreational, and FSC fisheries have contributed to the decline of several Pacific salmon stocks in British Columbia (BC). However, there are a multitude of non-fishing threats facing BC salmon that have not been fully identified nor characterized including Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS), harmful algal blooms (HABs), disease and pathogens, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals, etc. Further, many of these stressors can interact such that the cumulative effect of these stressors is likely greater than the sum of individual stressors. However, these stressors are unlikely evenly distributed across the Pacific such that different stocks will face different stressors and may respond differently. Thus, spatial and stock considerations will be critical. Finally, these stressors are affecting BC salmon at different life history stages across the freshwater, estuarine, and marine systems they utilize to complete their life cycle with climate change exacerbating the problem. By developing a decision support framework it will be possible to identify and characterize the individual and multiple stressors affecting salmon productivity or recovery in a standardized way among Pacific salmon stocks. This will allow managers to better incorporate and mitigate these non-fishing stressors most impacting salmon in decision making. Not only will this conveying a more complete understanding of stock status and threats to industry, stakeholders, and First Nations it will facilitate the inclusion of this information in fisheries management plans and SARA recovery plans. Further, this approach will allow targeting limited resources to those stressors that can best be managed with a clearer understanding of how salmon may be expected to respond when these threats are mitigated.  
Based on the non-fishing threats identified in the previous year, along with their expected impacts on BC salmon stocks, we will develop a geospatial dataset of these threats that can then be attributed to individual stocks. By developing an interaction matrix it will be possible to specify the stock-specific threats facing BC salmon and clearly indicate which management decision making processes need to include this information (e.g., fishing plan, recovery plan).

At the Nov 2022 workshop our breakout group identified a number of known stressors and in some cases we were able to identify specific threats to salmon. However, we had a much longer list of potential stressors for which we did not have subject matter experts. Thus, the first step will be to hire a dedicated BI-02 who will undertake a literature review, including Fisheries Management Plans, CSAS Advisory Documents, SARA Recovery Potential Assessments and Recovery Plans, to identify a range of non-fishing stressors affecting salmon and how DFO currently considers/doesn’t consider them in decision making. The second step will be to talk to subject matter experts both withing and outside DFO to fill information gaps that are identified during the initial review. This preliminary list will then be used in the third step, targeted workshops, where the experts will work to identify the causal mechanisms behind these stressors (e.g., life history stage affected, type of impact, duration, intensity, magnitude, recovery, etc.) and how they can be better considered in DFO decision making. This dual approach of literature review and expert opinions has been used previously to identify stressors impacting kelp recovery in the Salish Sea (Hollarsmith et al. 2022).

Based on the results of the first two years of the project, the third year will specifically develop decision support tools that will aid managers in how best to incorporate non-fishing threats across an array of DFO management and policy decision making processes, including, but not limited to Fisheries Management, SARA recovery planning, SEP restoration activities, and FFHPP integrated planning processes. Further, by developing this in conjunction with First Nations, it will expand on existing DFO’s efforts on Reconciliation.

Regular monitoring of harmful algal biotoxins in BC coastal waters since 2020 (Ross and Mueller, 2024) has revealed significant correlations between climate variables (e.g. water temperature) and the concentrations of these toxins in areas known to be frequented by Pacific salmon, including WCVI Chinook for which harmful algae have been identified as a high future risk (PSSI Risk Assessment Workshop #3). The goal of this project is to build upon our Biotoxin Monitoring Program (DFO Fieldnote OSDOEB_10) by adapting established analytical methods and procedures to measure harmful algal biotoxins in Pacific salmon, their prey and habitat. This information will be combined with environmental and taxonomic (plankton) data, and assessments of the health and condition of sampled fish, to help predict the effects of climate change and related processes on the exposure of Pacific salmon to these toxins, and potential impacts on their health and survival.

2023-2024,2417,Optimization of feeds used in the hatchery production of Pacific Salmon.,PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,"Ian Forster, Cher LaCoste",Approved,"To date, much of the recent research on salmonid diets and formulation of nutritionally complete commercial feeds has focused on rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon (NRC 2011, Hardy and Kaushik 2021). These feeds are not formulated for Pacific salmon, which require a specific balance of nutrients and other diet constituents to assure egg and juvenile quality, parr-smolt transformation and subsequent performance in seawater (Hanson et al. 2016, Perry et al. 2006, Jutfelt et al. 2007), as well as to limit the stress response following seawater introduction (Herrera et al. 2019). To this end, we propose to formulate and test new diets specific for the production of Pacific salmon, especially Chinook and coho, optimized to SEP hatcheries.

The data collected in Year 1 will help us to select diets for use in feeding trials to be conducted at SEP facilities rearing Coho and Chinook salmon in Years 2 and 3. Collectively, these data will support the future formulation of improved diets for Pacific salmon.

Feeding trials will be conducted at SEP hatcheries in Years 2 and 3 on juvenile ocean-type Chinook and Coho salmon. The diets to be compared will be selected based upon the results of Year 1 and agreed upon by the research team and SEP staff. Dr. Forster, the project lead, has extensive experience in conducting and peer-review publishing comparative feeding trials in salmon. Other team members have extensive experience in the assessment of physiological, immunological and health status of salmon.

Ultimately, this project will provide science-based advice to SEP facilities on the use of supplemented or specially formulated diets to better meet the needs of Pacific salmon and specifically address management concerns as to whether current industry-formulated feeds administered to juvenile ocean-type Chinook and Coho are sufficiently optimized.

2023-2024,2418,Prediction of reproductive success of Chinook salmon based on Thiamine concentrations in returning adults.,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,"Ian Forster, Cher LaCoste",Approved,"What is being proposed: Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency complex (TDC) is an emerging issue of concern for Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, in the North Pacific. Thiamine is an essential vitamin for all organisms, that is derived from their diet. Deficiency is most overtly expressed in salmonids as early mortality of fry, but secondary effects impact all life stages. TDC was first observed in the North Pacific in 2014 when up to 70% of Chinook from the Yukon River, a system which has experienced declines in Chinook productivity, were found to have limiting levels of egg thiamine (Larson and Howard 2019; Honeyfield et al. 2016). In 2020, TDC was diagnosed for the first time in California Chinook and found responsible for excessive fry mortality. Despite its presence both north and south of BC, to date, only a single study has measured thiamine levels in BC salmon and this included just two Chinook (Welch et al. 2018). TDC may already be an important driver of BC Chinook salmon population declines, and is expected to be an increasingly important issue as oceans warm and prey communities change. Significantly, when TDC is diagnosed there are effective treatment strategies to mitigate the effects which can be applied in hatcheries to limit fry mortality. Assessment and monitoring, of Thiamine deficiency can be used by SEP and StAD to inform planning decisions for stocks where expectations of reduced spawning performance may be expected, e.g., SEP could use this information to focus egg collection efforts, or remediation actions such as Thiamine injection / baths, on stocks that may be at greater risk of low spawning success. StAD could use this information to improve their assessment of the current status and health of salmon stocks.

2023-2024,2421,Measurement of stress hormones in scales and its application for the identification of conditions causing chronic stress in Pacific Salmon.,PSSI (B-base),Biotechnology and Genomics,Stewart Johnson,Submitted,"Exposure of fish to stressors can elicit physiological changes at multiple levels of animal organization, these alterations are collectively known as the stress response. The hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis which is activated in response to most forms of stress in fish, initiates and regulates the stress response. In fish cortisol is the predominant glucocorticoid released as part of the primary stress response, and is critical for mediating adaptive metabolic, physiological, and behavioral adjustments. However, prolonged elevation of cortisol, due to extended or repeated exposure to stressors, can negatively affect fish behavior, growth, reproduction and immune functions (reviewed in Schreck and Tort, 2016).

The analysis of circulating (serum/plasma) cortisol is the most common method used in stress response assessments in fish. This method works well under controlled situations, where fish can be caught and rapidly sampled (within minutes to avoid the rapid increase in cortisol which occurs in response to capture stress) and it provides information on the acute stress response at the time of collection (immediate state of stress). However, to understand chronic stress the past cortisol history of individuals needs to be understood. Fish scales have been recently recognized as a biomaterial that accumulates cortisol, and other physiologically important hormones including cortisone, over long periods of time. Moreover, scale cortisol levels are not affected by stress associated with capture (reviewed in Laberge et al. 2019; Kennedy and Janz, 2023).

Cortisol is released from the interrenals in fish as a biologically active steroid hormone. At the tissue level, the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11βhsd2) converts cortisol into its biologically inactive metabolite, cortisone. Importantly, this step is irreversible in fish, highlighting the importance of 11βhsd2 in the regulation of cortisol levels in teleosts (Tsachaki et al. 2017). Since 11βhsd2 is present in fish skin, assessing the expression of this enzyme in the skin during chronic stress, and measuring both cortisol and cortisone content will provide critical context for scale cortisol deposition and clearance, and further validate the use of scales as an indicator of chronic stress in fish.

We are proposing the use of levels of stress hormones (cortisol, cortisone) in scales as a tool for routine monitoring of chronic stress in different life history stages of Pacific salmon. As an example, this tool could be used to examine individual and population effects of external stressors encountered during migration on cortisol dynamics, which has implications with respect to population resilience to stressors such as climate change. The use of scales is minimally invasive and therefore suitable for use in populations of conservation concern. However, to interpret values obtained from scales we first need to understand the temporal profile of stress hormone accumulation and rates of clearance in scales under different environmental conditions for the different species of Pacific Salmon.

In this project we will conduct laboratory and hatchery-based studies to determine/optimize: 1) sampling methods (e.g. study spatial heterogeneity of scale stress hormone content (SSHC)), 2) effects of acute vs. chronic stress on SSHC, 3) relationship between plasma and SSHC, 4) individual, stock and temporal variability in SSHC, including changes associated with smoltification, and 5) effects of unpredictable chronic stress on plasma and SSHC. We will use, and modify, if necessary, analytical methods for SSHC that have been used in studies of goldfish and rainbow trout (Laberge et al. 2019; Kennedy and Janz, 2023).

2023-2024,2423,Complementing British Columbia’s coasts longest Sea Surface Temperature and Salinity records with 21st century technology to monitor a changing climate.,PSSI (B-base),Climate Change and Oceans,Sebastien Donnet,Approved,"At present, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data are collected as part of DFO’s British Columbia Shore Station Program (BCSOP) at twelve coastal stations that have been monitored for several decades, the earliest commencing in 1914 (see map below).

The data are collected manually, by lighthouses keepers, at a daily interval. Despite its success in providing data at remote locations for an outstanding duration (one of the longest in the world of this kind), the program faces challenges and limitations: gaps due to weather conditions, concerns with lighthouse keepers payment, time lag between data collection and reception and relatively coarse observational resolution. Theses challenges result in gaps in the timeseries which can limit their otherwise wide range of possible applications.

To address those challenges and enhance these valuable timeseries, we propose the testing and deployment of autonomous systems which can record SST and SSS at higher frequency (e.g. hourly) and transmit those data in near real-time. The system would consist of an in-situ sensors package, a data logger and transmitter and an antenna. Examples of such systems include elements of the Ocean Network Canada (https://data.oceannetworks.ca/home) and of Smart Atlantic, on the East coast (https://www.smartatlantic.ca/station_alt.html?id=dfo_nharb).

The main outcome of this project will be the acquisitions of continuous, gap-free, high resolution (hourly) timeseries of SST and SSS at key sites along the BC coast. These timeseries would be available in real-time mode and/or delay mode and posted online via the Open Data portal (https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/719955f2-bf8e-44f7-bc26-6bd623e82884) as well as on the Ocean Network Canada and Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS, https://cioos.ca/about/). The number of sites to be equipped upon successful testing (1st year) will depend on budget available (details below); a minimum of 4 stations would be necessary to be representative of the BC coast as a whole, i.e. Salish Sea (Chrome Island to Race Rocks), West coast (Amphitrite Point to Kains Island), North coast (Pine Island to Bonilla Island) and Haida Gwaii (Langara Island). Region and station priorities would be defined upon results of the first year tests and in coordination with other researchers and PSSI priorities.

SST and SSS characteristics determine the suitability of marine ecosystems habitat for native and invasive species that impacts migration patterns, predator-prey relationships and stock abundance. Data from the BCSOP currently contributes to fisheries management as input into forecasts of the northern diversion of Fraser River sockeye and models of salmon and anchovy stock abundance in the Strait of Georgia. Thus, enhanced data from this initiative would not only strengthen the current applications but also be helpful to newly implemented PSSI initiatives.

2023-2024,2424,Mechanistic modelling to link hydrology to juvenile salmon habitat quality and productivity,PSSI (B-base),Freshwater Habitat Research,Sean Naman,Submitted,"Hydrology is a key determinant of salmon productivity and persistence in freshwater and is rapidly changing in many areas from human activities and climate warming. Yet, it remains challenging to make explicit predictions about how hydrology influences salmon. We aim to advance a mechanistic and tractable modelling framework that links hydrology (flow and temperature) to local-scale habitat availability and productivity potential of stream-rearing juvenile salmon. The proposed approach integrates well-established theory of geomorphology and fish energetics to predict how juvenile salmon rearing habitat availability and productivity potential is influenced by dynamic flow and temperature regimes (Fig. 1). The approach aims to be accessible by using a tractable set of inputs that would emerge from typical field habitat monitoring and is applicable across different systems and salmonid species. We propose rolling out this modelling framework as part of a larger watershed-scale research program in the North Thompson, where we have established an extensive field monitoring network of flow, temperature, and habitat conditions that would be direct model inputs. Ongoing intensive monitoring of juvenile coho populations and physiological condition (D. Patterson proposal) in these systems will inform model validation. For example, modelled predictions could be directly compared to measures of coho abundance, production, or physiological condition.

We anticipate 3 main outcomes from the work: (1) a modelling framework and interface (e.g., R Shiny App); (2) predictions of how juvenile coho rearing habitat availability and productivity potential responds to diverse flow and temperature regimes across tributaries of the North Thompson; and (3) advice to internal and external clients for setting environmental flow guidelines under dynamic hydrologic conditions. For example, the work will directly plug into ongoing engagement with the Thompson-Shuswap Environmental Flows Committee, which is actively developing flow management guidelines and drought response thresholds for the region. Further, the modelling framework will provide a platform to explore the potential consequences of climate and land use impacts on flows and temperatures, e.g., based on broader-scale, climate averaged temperature and flow projections under climate change (J. Iacarella proposal). This would provide a powerful, yet computationally simple and accessible way to explore and communicate the dynamic relationships between flows and salmon in a warming world. Overall, the approach is easily extendable to other systems and salmonid species, thus could become a widely used tool across the Province.

Approaches to predict biological responses to flow are integral to numerous management issues. We envision the modelling framework informing regulatory decision-making by FFHPP related to flow alterations (e.g., hydro operations or water withdrawals), as well as land use and restoration planning. Our work fills a gap for these applications given that existing instream flow modelling tends to either be static and descriptive and thus not applicable to dynamic conditions, or have prohibitively steep information and computational requirements. This is a 3-year project that would support two parallel elements: (1) collection of habitat, flow, and temperature data in coho rearing tributaries across the North Thompson; and (2) development of model structure and interface. Manuscript and report preparation and client engagement will occur primarily in years 2 and 3.

This project represents continued support for the Freshwater Spatial Ecology Program (Freshwater Ecosystems Section, ESD) which is providing three main outputs at a province wide scale that are critical for salmon management: geospatial layers to evaluate salmon habitat, salmon habitat suitability under current and future climate conditions, and cumulative effects on salmon freshwater habitat. Through these outputs, the program is working to address a very large gap in DFO’s understanding of where there is environmentally suitable and healthy habitat for salmon in freshwater, where there is at-risk habitat, and how this relates to salmon productivity at large spatial scales. This information is essential to meaningfully conduct any management prioritization related to the reliance of salmon populations on freshwater habitats, but is challenging to obtain given the extensive spatial scale of the Pacific Region and limited data.

Expected outcomes for Year 1: (1) Modelled and mapped August mean stream temperatures for 20-year time intervals across climate change scenarios; (2) Collation of remote sensing data for BC and beginning analysis to identify riparian and off channel habitat for salmon; (3) Maps of experimentally-derived thermally tolerable and intolerable streams under climate change conditions across BC linked to known locations of juvenile habitat use; (4) Completion of thermal growth experiments from egg to fry for two populations of coho under naturally variable stream conditions and +2/+4 °C temperature treatments; (5) Modelled and mapped cumulative effect scores for salmon spawning habitat across the Fraser basin (to be extended province wide provided ongoing funding), and assessment of change in cumulative effects seasonally and over time delivered as a CSAS Research Document for FFHPP Integrated Planning; (6) Modelled and mapped environmentally suitable streams (and uncertainty estimation) under current and future climate conditions for all 5 Pacific salmon species across BC; and (7) Spatial analysis of modelled, climate averaged flow and stream temperature based threats on salmon ecosystems under climate change in the Thompson-Nicola region delivered as a CSAS Science Response for FFHPP Integrated Planning for Salmon Ecosystems.

2023-2024,2426,Sakinaw Sockeye Juvenile Research on Measures to Increase Marine Survival,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,"Kevin Pellett, Nicolette Watson, Karalea Filipovic",Submitted,"Sakinaw sockeye smolts out-migrate from Sakinaw Lake each spring into the Strait of Georgia. Recovery efforts have determined that the marine survival of this population is very low, which is a major limiting factor to population recovery. On water surveys of pinnipeds from the estuary out to the seal haul outs on Hodgson Islands (approximately 2km from the estuary, Figure 1) during the spring out-migration timing (since 2019) have estimated from approximately 100-350 harbour seals in the area.

This project was started as a pilot in 2022 to test the hypothesis that the Hodgson Island harbour seal population is negatively affecting smolt survival, and subsequently adult returns. The goal of the project is to transport and release smolts past the seal haul out and then compare marine survival rates between transported smolts and those out-migrating naturally. The pilot project began with a low number of smolts transported in small trial releases to test the effect of additional handling/ osmoregulation on fish as well as the function of equipment. Small numbers of fish were PIT tagged to confirm fish are able to recover from the procedure and be transported on the same day. Additional activities included continuation of harbour seal counts (Figure 2) on local haul outs during the smolt (May) and adult (July) peak migration windows. Transport activities are conducted with shíshálh Nation’s newly acquired 30 foot aluminum landing craft which is suited to this kind of work.

In years 2-5 (spring 2023-2026), we propose scaling up releases to achieve adequate sample sizes in order to properly test the hypothesis. A minimum of 1,000 and up to 2,500 PIT tagged sockeye are recommended per year such that a 1% survival will yield a total of 10-25 tag returns. Return rates of less than 1% may be too low to justify operationalizing this activity long term. The transport of non-tagged fish should be avoided as to not confound comparisons with the control group (untagged fence migrants). Results from 2023/24 releases will be realized in 2025/26 escapement years at which point a decision on the future of the project can be made. Additional activities may include walking the Hodson Island haul out with a mobile PIT tag antenna to look for evidence of predation on out migrating smolts (river or transport groups; Coho and Sockeye), or installing a PIT antenna on the haul out.

Sakinaw Sockeye has been confirmed as an endangered stock since 2003, and a recovery potential assessment, completed in 2017 cited low marine survival as the greatest limiting factor in recovery, with predator abundance and assumed predation on smolts and adults ranked as high risk, with a critical level of impact. Perpetually low marine survivals are preventing recovery such that the persistence of the population is entirely dependent on a captive brood program. This activity may be one of the few tools available to increase survival.

This analysis was used to develop a predictive model of survival. The current sampling frequency is monthly. Increased frequency, particularly in the spring and fall will allow better resolution of physical processes and on match-mismatch between juvenile salmon and they prey in the Strait. Further, increased sampling frequency will improve resolution of physical measurements which benefit both statistical power and model prediction. The project expands upon the current monthly SoG plankton survey program (22 stations) to include additional biweekly surveys starting mid-February through to mid-April and then again late August through end of September. These additional surveys would target a key subset of stations with: 1) sampling focused on the plankton component of juvenile salmon diets (krill, amphipods, and decapod larvae); 2) biochemical measurements of zooplankton production rates and photochemical measurements of phytoplankton production rates; and 3) ancillary measurements required for estimates of food web energy transfer efficiency. The primary objective is to measure the quantity, quality, and production rate of a key dietary component as well as the entire zooplankton community. Variation of zooplankton production rates are more sensitive than biomass to environmental variation occurring on timescales relevant to juvenile salmon foraging. Community-level productivity estimates will be used to measure ecological efficiency; the amount of energy available to consumers of zooplankton.

2023-2024,2430,Feasibility of Estimating Chilko River Smolt Abundance Using Upward- and Side-Looking SONAR Methods,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Daniel Doutaz,Submitted,"Chilko Sockeye salmon represent the only wild Sockeye indicator stock in the Fraser watershed. The annual Chilko Lake Sockeye smolt assessment (1951-present) comprises the only long-term time series data available to assess juvenile recruitment, and freshwater and marine productivity for wild Fraser River Sockeye salmon. Since program inception, Sockeye smolts have been enumerated during their out-migration from Chilko Lake using a traditional fish counting weir and photographic sampling/counting techniques. During the first six decades of the program (1951-2012), interruptions in weir operation were relatively rare: in only three years (1979, 1993, 2006) did early freshets necessitate removal of the weir before the vast majority of smolts had migrated from Chilko Lake.

Recently, unusually early freshets have been experienced in the Chilko watershed that have translated into high and variable water conditions much earlier in the season. As such, DFO Stock Assessment crews were not able to operate the weir in 2015 due to high water flows, and have had to remove the weir structure prior to the completion of smolt migration on numerous other recent years (e.g., 2019). The observed increase in the frequency of early freshets in the Chilko watershed is consistent with predicted hydrographic changes for interior BC streams as a whole in response to climate variability, with the average timing of the spring freshet expected to continue shifting earlier as air temperatures rise. The future of operating the Chilko Sockeye smolt weir is in jeopardy given the current trend related to the timing, frequency, and strength of the spring freshets. If proven effective, the SONAR method would provide an alternate assessment method for the Chilko watershed that could be quickly employed in years when high flows either prevent the installation of the weir at the beginning of the migration, or necessitate the removal of the weir before the smolt migration is largely complete.

The objective of this work is to test the feasibility of using upward-looking SONAR technology to assess daily abundances of Chilko Lake sockeye smolts as they migrate downstream through the Chilko River. This technology has proven to be effective for enumerating migrating smolts in comparable rivers in Alaska. The reliably of the method will be evaluated based on how well the daily SONAR-derived abundance indices predict the daily migration totals observed at the counting weir that is deployed annually on the Chilko River. A pilot study employing this technology was initiated within the Chilko watershed in the spring of 2021, and following two consecutive years of data collection the results appear to be promising; however, in both 2021 and 2022, water levels have been below seasonal averages and we have yet to experience a high-water event with the SONARs in place. Additional years of this project are therefore required before any conclusions can be made regarding the effectiveness of this technology as a substitute for the currently employed counting weir on the Chilko River.

We would continue this monitoring, and add two additional moorings in the Strait of Georgia / Haro Strait to obtain high temporal and vertical resolution data on key ecosystem components (zooplankton and krill, juvenile salmon, forage species, and adult salmon – in particular Chinook due to their large size). The new mooring positions would be strategically selected to build on ongoing sampling programs in the Salish Sea. 2) Build on existing acoustic-trawl surveys in the Strait of Georgia (focused on Pacific Hake and walleye pollock assessments) to develop spatially-explicit estimates of krill biomass for the Strait and main inlets, along with information on density and distribution of forage fish species (e.g. Pacific herring). Other surveys within the Salish Sea also collect acoustic data that would feed into these estimates, such as the Spring and Fall juvenile salmon surveys (Neville). 3) Incorporate portable echosounder systems to complement current zooplankton and oceanographic sampling efforts (Sastri). 4) Carry out dedicated small-scale acoustic surveys in targeted areas to assess poorly monitored forage fish species that are important for salmon, with particular attention to Pacific Sandlance.

The specific case study that we will use as a proof of concept for this technology is the GREB1L gene in Puntledge River Chinook Salmon. GREB1L is a gene that explains a large amount of the variation in run timing for Chinook Salmon. Specific SNPs in the GREB1L gene are currently used as diagnostic genetic markers to retroactively distinguish between summer and fall runs of Chinook in the Puntledge River Hatchery. These markers have two alleles one of which is primarily carried by early returning Chinook Salmon and the other by late returning salmon. Current management of enhancement at the Puntledge River Hatchery uses a date threshold to ensure most ""summer run"" fish carry the early-run allele to preserve the genetic integrity of this population segment. Rapid in-season genotyping results would allow more accurate and expanded use of available broodstock for the Puntledge summer run. SHERLOCK assays are field deployable genotyping assays that can generate a result in under an hour and may provide this capacity to enhancement efforts in the Puntledge River. The technology has previously been demonstrated for rapid genotyping purposes including GREB1L markers in California populations of Chinook Salmon.

In the initial phases of the project, the focus will begin on the southern coastal populations. While stock delineation using the existing SNP panel is close to Conservation Unit-level resolution, there remain difficult delineations to make that are of interest to stock assessment and management. For year 1, the focus will be predominately on the lower Fraser, where delineation of Chilliwack River from the remaining lower Fraser populations remains difficult in the current analysis methods but is desired to support management objectives. To better understand what differentiates these populations, we will use next generation sequencing technologies to perform low-coverage whole genome sequencing on a selection of spawning populations in the lower Fraser, Chilliwack River, and select populations in the Salish sea in the first year - this will include enhanced stocks from each region. Future analyses will identify where differences stocks exist and allow for the selection of genetic markers to better delineate among them, thereby allowing for more accurate assessment and enhancement methods using genetic techniques.

This initial effort will be built upon in future years by extending sampling to additional regions where further stock delineation is necessitated to meet assessment and enhancement objectives, such as Strait of Georgia/Howe Sound, West Coast Vancouver Island, and Johnstone Strait and the Central Coast.

2023-2024,2437,Adaptive genetic variation and climate change resilience in Canadian Pacific salmon,PSSI (B-base),Biotechnology and Genomics,"Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband",Submitted,"Pacific salmon are broadly distributed across western Canada and the northern Pacific Ocean with spawning grounds located over a wide diversity of freshwater habitats. In general, Pacific salmon return to their natal spawning grounds to reproduce, and not surprisingly this has resulted in substantial genetic variation among different salmon populations throughout the Canadian range. Genetic variants among and within populations of the majority of Canadian Pacific salmon have been characterized using relatively low numbers of genetic markers, and this characterization has enabled the development of the genetic-stock identification and parentage-based tagging programs within Fisheries and Oceans Canada which provide vital information for management of fisheries and hatcheries. Despite the utility of these developments, low-density genetic markers are insufficient to assess adaptive genetic variation in these species, leaving critical gaps for conserving fitness-associated genetic diversity and for improving resilience to climate change. Previously, the costs of next-generation sequencing were prohibitive for assessing genome-wide genetic variation in species with large genomes such as salmonids. However, reductions in these costs combined with publication of reference genome sequences for the Pacific salmonids has opened novel opportunities to address these gaps. The proposed project will utilize low-coverage whole-genome resequencing to assess genome-wide patterns of genetic variation among and within populations of Pacific salmon. These data will feed into several analyses to identify genomic regions and variation involved in environmental adaptation, to reassess the genetic support for currently defined conservation unit boundaries, and to estimate the relative climate change resilience of different populations of Canadian Pacific salmon. Initially, the proposed project will focus on Chinook and Sockeye Salmon with a goal of sequencing individuals from 48 populations of each species distributed across the species’ range. We will leverage samples currently available in the Molecular Genetics DNA archives to enable these efforts. In the longer-term, the objectives of this project will expand these sequencing efforts to increase the coverage of individuals, populations and species of Pacific salmon. This expansion of scope will be necessary to fully consider conservation of within population genetic diversity, and to resolve parallel patterns of genetic adaptation across Pacific salmon in Canada. The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Identify 48 populations representative of the range-wide diversity of Chinook and Sockeye Salmon. 2) Obtain samples from 18 Chinook individuals or 8 Sockeye individuals from each identified population from the Molecular Genetics DNA archives, and extract DNA for each sample. 3) Prepare the extracted DNA samples for low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, and submit the samples to an external sequencing service provider. 4) Collect relevant environmental datasets and climate change projections for the locations and life histories of the identified populations. 5) Receive sequencing reads for all submitted DNA samples. The long-term objectives of the study are: 6) Align sequencing reads from the first year of the study to the Chinook or Sockeye Salmon reference genomes. 7) Determine allele frequency variation among and within populations of each species. 8) Analyze genome-wide population structure in each species and identify outlier regions of genetic differentiation among populations. 9) Analyze genome-environment associations to resolve environmental factors underlying genetic differentiation among populations. 10) Utilize current inter-population genomic variation to determine “genomic offsets” in the context of climate change projections (i.e., the extent of genetic change necessary to parallel expected changes in the environment). 11) Expand sampling and sequencing effort to include Chum, Pink and Coho Salmon, and to add additional Chinook and Sockeye Salmon population that address any gaps in the initial analysis. 12) Repeat the analyses above across species to evaluate cross-species patterns and factors important to Pacific salmon adaptation in Canada. 13) Report on genome-wide genetic variation in comparison to existing conservation unit boundaries with dedicated consideration of putatively adaptive genetic variation. 14) Report on genetic estimates of relative climate change resilience among different populations of each Pacific salmon species examined.

2023-2024,2439,Modernizing Fish Age Estimation using Fourier Transform-Near Infrared and Neural Network Techniques,PSSI (B-base),Biotechnology and Genomics,Stephen Wischniowski,Approved,"The Sclerochronology Lab (SCL) provides a unique central service for Pacific Regional DFO clientele involved in the management of commercially important species of salmon, herring, groundfish and shellfish by providing users with consistent high quality age estimates, monitoring growth patterns influenced by environmental pressures, and providing products and services developed through strategic, innovative and collaborative research programs. Age information is a key piece of data used by biologists to assess the health of marine fin/shellfish populations (Ricker 1975; Hilborn and Walters 1992; Campana and Thorrold 2001). Age structured stock assessments facilitate judicious fisheries resource management decisions commonly via CSAS processes which depend on high quality and consistent age-data. Commercial Fisheries programs are managed in partnership with stakeholders relying on scientific assessments and are dependent on consultative processes to develop and review policies, procedures and regulations.

SCL intellectual knowledge achieved through the experience of long-term observations (40+yrs) (Campana, 1992; Hesler et al., 2019) is safeguarded not only in documentation, but more so as a living document in the staff's collective ability to recognize and identify growth patterns. To maintain this continuous and uninterrupted level of service the SCL relies on a comprehensive training regime designed specifically to withstand sporadic events of attrition including the loss of knowledge by way of retirements. Managing staff changes in the SCL, particularly retirements post 2020 has seen an unprecedented number of senior staff retire, fundamentally challenging the SCL’s ability to maintain the forementioned scope of training and intellectual knowledge. The SCL, and other Committee of Fish Ageing Experts (CARE) agencies are recognizing that the reliance on traditional ways of fish age estimation may not be sustainable as demands only seem to increase while the ability to retain knowledgeable staff diminishes.

The SCL has initiated investigations into alternative means of estimating fish age. Fourier Transform-Near Infrared (FT-NIR) Spectroscopy and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently gained attention in the ability to reproduce accurate age assignments when calibrated against known age, or the best age that can be provided, to produced results complimentary to the traditional means of estimation fish age. Both techniques require continuous “training” or “maintenance” to ensure that all variations of patterned growth both spatial and temporarily are experienced by the algorithm. Once sufficient volume has been attained the output capacity and time required to produce age assignments is substantially faster than what can be attained by traditional ageing.

Fourier Transform-Near Infrared. FT-NIR spectroscopy has recently been applied to rapidly predict fish age, gaining attention among fisheries managers as a potential alternative to timely and costly production ageing of managed species (Passerotti et al., 2020). Age prediction capability of FT-NIRS has been tested on the otoliths of chinook salmon (Claiborne et al., 2019), walleye pollock (Hesler et al., 2019), red snapper (Passerotti et al., 2020), barramundi (Wright et al., 2021), Pacific cod (Healy et al., 2021), longnose skate (Arrington et al., 2021) as well as the vertebrae of two shark species (Rigby et al. 2014, 2016), with potentially promising results. Studies on eastern Bering Sea walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) have shown that ages derived from FT-NIRS are not only precise but may demonstrate less bias than traditional ageing methods (Helser et al., 2018). Studies conducted by collaborators at NOAA have indicated that FT-NIRS has the capacity to increase age outputs of walleye pollock from 35 ages per day to 360 ages per day (Hesler et al., 2019). If successful, new applications of FT-NIRS technology will provide a promising approach to consolidate research tools, operationalize timely data collection methods for age determination directly benefiting fisheries researchers and managers, as well as other research projects led by StAR, SEP, and Indigenous communities.

Convolutional Neural Networks. Significant progress in use of automated pattern recognition based on machine learning has been achieved in recent years. The availability of deep learning packages for open-source software has provided the opportunity to analyze large volumes of unstructured data (e.g., images, video, audio, etc.) quickly and efficiently (Polacek et al. 2022). These advancements in deep learning have proven effective at solving a range of complex problems related to unstructured data in many disciplines, including the age assignments of otoliths and scales of teleost’s (Cayetano et al. 2024, Moen et al. 2018 and Vabo et al. 2021). The SCL is working in collaboration with the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSFRC) in the development of a computer vision (CHUMputer Vision) pipeline to predict the age assignments of Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) by way of digitized scale images. Both the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) and the Pacific Biological Station will provide selected pre-aged scale images of Chum (age range 0 to 7 yrs.) to train the Python data pipeline code. To ensure model robustness sufficient samples of all age ranges must be configured. Currently, sufficient age classes of 03 and 04 (European age classification) are contained. The Sclerochronology Lab will sources shoulder year age classes, assist in imaging, preprocess enhancement and model testing. Chum have been selected for their ease of interpretation of the non-freshwater pattern. Ultimately however, the goal is to reach algorithm sophistication to interpret the complexities of freshwater growth patterns, to which age assignments can be estimated for Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha).

2023-2024,2440,Mat-37 Improvements to the evaluation of abundance and stock composition for Fraser River Juvenile Salmon,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,"Matthew Townsend, Kaitlyn Dionne",Submitted,"A juvenile salmon trapping project has been conducted in the Fraser River at Mission biannually since 1960. This project is currently executed by Fraser and Interior Area Stock Assessment Division (FIA StAD) and has historically focused on Pink Salmon. In 2014, the Southern Endowment fund funded the project “Evaluation of abundance of stock composition of downstream migrating juvenile Sockeye Salmon in the Lower Fraser River” (now colloquially called the Mission juvenile downstream project). This additional funding allowed the expansion of this work to include a rotary screw trap (RST) which has been annually deployed and is capable of trapping yearling smolts of Sockeye, Chinook, and Coho Salmon. Pink Salmon juvenile passage estimates have been generated biannually using 60 year-old methods, while the only metric of juvenile Sockeye, Chinook, and Coho Salmon passage is an index of CPUE as this estimate is not calibrated to river discharge levels and therefore not comparable through time. Juvenile Chum Salmon are also caught and enumerated but currently no passage estimates are generated. DFO’s capacity to improve these estimates is impacted by high staff turnover and the scarcity of qualified individuals to hire. 1) We propose two years of funding for a graduate student in the Resource and Environmental Management Program to review our existing data sets and estimation methods and provide recommendations to modernize and improve these estimates. 2) As a result of this work we expect to a) Improve the operational and analytical methods used to estimate juvenile Pink Salmon passage through the Fraser River at Mission b) Use existing data to create a study design to estimate juvenile Sockeye, Chinook, Coho, and Chum passage through the Fraser River at Mission 3) Accurate assessment of total juvenile salmon passage through the Fraser River at Mission, combined with Genetic Stock Identification (GSI), will provide stock-specific estimates of freshwater survival for all Fraser River salmon species.

2023-2024,2442,Graduate Research into 1) habitat use by juvenile Chinook Salmon in the Canadian Okanagan River and Lake system and 2) predation on juvenile salmon in the Canadian Okanagan River and Lake system,PSSI (B-base),Freshwater Habitat Research,"Lauren Weir, John Gray",Submitted,"Okanagan Chinook are the only remaining Columbia River Chinook Salmon population in Canada. Their abundance is very low, currently less than a couple hundred spawners, but their abundance was likely in the high thousands before the Canadian Okanagan and Columbia River were developed for Agriculture, Flood Control, and Hydro-power Generation, resulting in physical exclusion from spawning and rearing habitats. Fishing rates have also been high through history, with recent (2009-2018) exploitation rates around 60%. The population in the U.S. section of the Okanagan River has recently ranged from 7,000-14,000 spawners.

COSEWIC has identified this single river Designatable Unit as ENGANGERED, and it is currently undergoing review for listing under the Species at Risk Act. Additionally, this stock is part of Batch 1 for the Fish Stock Provisions under the Fisheries Act. The DFO has considerable engagement with First Nations, the Okanagan Water Management Board, the Okanagan River Restoration Initiative, as well as the Colville Confederated Tribes, the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Pacific Salmon Commission. Rebuilding the abundance of Okanagan Chinook is a priority for First Nations and local, provincial, and national fisheries agencies on both sides of the boarder.

Recently, the Pacific Salmon Commission conducted a series of 5 workshops with fisheries professionals and First Nations which examined threats, impediments to survival, and mitigation approaches to increase the abundance of Okanagan Chinook. Similarly, a Recovery Potential Assessment (DFO Pacific Region CSAS) and DFO Risk Assessment Methods (RAMS) have been applied and also identified threats and mitigations. Among the issues identified in these assessments, the key ones include Climate Change and its influence on the thermal and hydrological regime of the Okanagan, channelization and the disconnection of the main river channels from the historic and off-channel stream habitats, and predation by invasive fish species. Two of the data gaps that were highlighted from this work are the juvenile habitat use in the Okanagan, which has been highly disturbed and degraded, and the level of predation on juvenile Chinook salmon by native and non-native fishes. To enable rebuilding it will be essential to have information on habitat use and to understand the threat posed by predation. Graduate students provide the most efficient way to answer these critical research questions. The use of graduate students will allow for targeted and timely research while building capacity and knowledge for when they enter the workforce.

2023-2024,2443,Quantitative assessment of the impact of Smallmouth Bass suppression efforts in Cultus Lake and SMB emigration from Cultus Lake,PSSI (B-base),Freshwater Habitat Research,Daniel Doutaz,Submitted,"Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), a piscivorous fish species native to eastern North America, have been introduced into Cultus Lake, British Columbia. Cultus Lake is home to endangered sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) as well as endemic Cultus pygmy sculpin (Cottus aleuticus). Smallmouth bass introduced in other salmon-bearing habitat have been observed to exert substantial mortality on salmon fry and smolts, suggesting a similar impact may be possible in Cultus Lake. Observations of sockeye salmon, and Cultus pygmy sculpin in the diet of captured smallmouth bass demonstrates predation upon two native species at risk. While smallmouth bass represent a threat to the Cultus Lake native fish community and species at risk specifically, they are also highly valued by some anglers. Importantly, as a source population, they also represent a real and present threat to other ecosystems in the Lower Mainland. Smallmouth bass are often found in streams and rivers; in fact, they have already been found downstream of Cultus Lake. Additionally, there is the threat of anglers moving smallmouth bass to other waterbodies in the Lower Mainland to create new bass fisheries, which themselves would create risk to receiving environments. While there are largemouth bass (M. salmoides) populations in various waterbodies throughout the Lower Mainland, this is the first verified smallmouth bass population, and has drawn a lot of attention from the angling community. Early work on this population has identified a divergence of public opinions: some value native species (especially sockeye salmon) and want to see bass suppressed; other values angling opportunities for smallmouth bass and will strongly oppose any measures to affect this valued fishery resource.

There are two issues that this project will address: (1) understanding which suppression options will result in the lowest opposition from anglers and community members, thereby identifying the risk of unintended consequences (e.g., additional transfers to other lakes); and (2) determining the suppression strategy (combination of different suppression options) which will best inform estimates of effectiveness for each suppression option so as to maximize effective suppression moving forward to reduce impacts on sockeye salmon recruitment.

In year one of this project, an electrofishing boat will be used to capture smallmouth bass, and all bass will be tagged with passive integrated transponders (PIT tags). These PIT-tagged fish will help determine the initial population size (through mark-recapture methods) and provide a baseline for future smallmouth bass suppression efforts. A subset of smallmouth bass will also be tagged using acoustic transmitters (n=25; Vemco V9 & V13 acoustic tags) to track their movements within the Cultus Lake system, and to determine if any emigration out of the system is occurring.

The smallmouth bass fishery will be monitored to assess total fishing effort (using standard access point creel survey procedures), harvest rates, harvest size, and catch rates (total number fish released + harvested). All harvested bass reported by anglers will be measured, weighted, scanned for PIT tags, and have scales removed for later aging. Additionally, as part of the catch monitoring program anglers will be surveyed to determine their level of satisfaction with their bass catch rates and size, native fish catch rates and their opinions on the different suppression options considered. These survey answers will allow for changes in utility and attitudes to be tracked over time.

Lastly, nest destruction and removal of male bass guarding nests is to occur once spawning begins in the spring. Bass activity in the spring should be monitored frequently to identify the start of spawning season. Once nests are constructed, a survey of known spawning locations should occur to identify nests for destruction. Captured males will be measured, weighed, have sex and maturity status confirmed, scanned for PIT tags, and have scales and/or otoliths removed for aging.

This project was developed in partnership between Simon Fraser University, the Province of BC, and the DFO. Please see the attached ""Cultus Lake Smallmouth Bass Suppression Plan.pdf"" in the ""Supporting Resources"" section for additional information on subsequent years of this project.

The work will be completed by an independent contractor who conducted similar studies previously (200-2012) and is familiar with the area and study design.

The field work will consist of calibrated night snorkeling surveys (Hagen et al. 2010) in the Lower Thompson River System including all major spawning tributaries (Nicola, Coldwater, Spius, Deadman, Criss, Bonaparte, and Thompson River mainstem) and subsequent data analysis and reporting over the winter months. It will draw closely on the previous steelhead and Chinook juvenile assessments completed by the contractor in the lower Thompson River system for both the design of field and analysis methods. Results from this work will contribute to the time series of juvenile abundance gathered over 10 years from 2001 to 2012 and the subsequent analysis.

This information will contribute to an assessment of ongoing impacts of the historic 2021 flood on Nicola 42 Chinook egg-to-fry survival and recruitment and will lead to a better understanding of the impacts of catastrophic flooding on salmonids generally and provide specific insights into Nicola recruitment and juvenile use of the post flood system. This information may provide insights into management decisions as well as on prioritizing watershed restoration activities. Additionally, this project could build on the previous fry assessment work to provide useful information about stock productivity and carrying capacity, and aid in developing escapement goals and recovery planning.

2023-2024,2447,Innovative Ecosystem Based Approaches to identify cumulative stressors: Salmon Fit-Chips and eDNA,PSSI (B-base),Biotechnology and Genomics,"Kristi Saunders, Arthur Bass, Christoph Deeg",Approved,"Climate change has negatively impacted productivity of many Canadian Pacific salmon stocks and species, but the cumulative interplay between environmental stress and changes to salmon ecosystems impacting survival are still yet to be fully evaluated. This knowledge is required to identify effective mediation strategies under anthropogenic control. An innovative salmon Fit-Chip tool is poised to fill this knowledge gap. The salmon Fit-Chip tool contains curated biomarker panels that can specifically recognize independent stressors (thermal, osmotic, hypoxia), disease states (viral), imminent mortality (natural death within 72 hours), and smolt readiness (differentiating pre-smolts, smolts and de-smolts), based on profiling from non-lethal gill biopsy samples. Fit-chips also contain biomarkers associated with inflammation and immune activation, and can include assays to key pathogens and parasites.

While physical oceanographic monitoring can provide environmental measures of temperature, oxygen, and salinity, they do not tell us whether fish are actually experiencing stress, or possibly avoiding areas where these stressors occur. Fit-Chip data allow us to directly test whether the highest ranking environmental risk factors identified in the WCVI Marine Risk Assessments—elevated temperature summer through early fall and reduced oxygen in the fall, the moderate risk of carryover effects (in this case smolt readiness rather than size) and exposure to HABs, cause physiological stress and impairment in Chinook salmon. Moreover, Fit-Chips can effectively identify habitats where salmon are least vs most compromised, allowing regulators and habitat biologists to target remediation where needed most, with remediation success tracked via decreased stress.

Working within the West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) ""Follow the fish"" Research Consortium funded under PSSI, under objective 1, we will run Fit-Chips on 2,000 Chinook released from Robertson and Nitinat hatcheries sampled over the migration trajectory from freshwater-estuary-marine, including overwintering Chinook caught across all 5 WCVI sounds through microtrolling led by local First Nations. Using a south coast wide Fit-Chip dataset developed in 2022-2023 using PSSI funding, comprised of over 4500 Chinook sampled from 2008-2018, we will employ stock-recruitment models to identify associations between individual stressors and population-level survival across the southern BC coast, and build a new model framework to address the cumulative interplay between stress and disease undermining survival. This analysis will address several of the risk factors identified in the WCVI Marine Risk Assessment for Chinook salmon, including climate-driven environmental stressors (temperature, hypoxia, salinity) and pathogens/disease, and their association with survival. We will then apply this knowledge to our Fit-Chip data on WCVI Chinook collected from 2022-2024, along with the physical oceanographic data collected at the same time, to identify where and when environmental stressors are “felt” by WCVI Chinook, including their relationship with measured environmental parameters, and where and when signs of increased morbidity occur. Importantly, this spatial analysis will also address the anthropogenically controlled intrinsic and extrinsic factors associated with stressors and diseases that pose the highest population-level risk to WCVI Chinook. The ultimate goal is to identify stressor and/or disease impacts that can be effectively mediated to increase early marine survival of salmon, and habitats where mediation is most urgently required.

The WCVI Marine Risk Assessments identified prey availability/feeding a high current and future risk, pathogens/parasites a moderate current and high future risk, and predation/HABs a moderate risks. Data gaps were identified for all of these risk factors. While multiple individual projects are proposed to tackle most of these risk factors and where they are most strongly felt in Barclay and Clayoquot Sound, eDNA offers a more holistic tool to identify the species compositions – e.g. salmon spp, predators, prey, competitors, infective agents, HABs, that can corroborate community assessment more efficiently over a broader spatial scale. Under objective 2, we will carry out eDNA sampling in the same areas and seasons where the follow the fish project is actively catching fish, starting in the estuaries and Barclay Sound in spring/summer, and moving into Clayoquot sound in the early fall and throughout all five sounds overwinter. In addition to providing an ecosystem characterization via metabarcoding, and pathogens through our infective agent monitoring system -- including potential hot-spot areas around farms/processing plants, eDNA may also provide more information on areas of the sound where salmon are more or less abundant. Importantly, under this objective we will integrate data analyses with projects using a more traditional species assessments (e.g. via plankton sampling, HAB monitoring, hydroacoustics). Importantly, when contrasting eDNA community compositions in ecosystems where salmon show indices of optimal vs compromised health, we can provide a second pillar to develop and measure the effectiveness of mediation efforts.

2. Cumulative effects modeling will assess the cumulative and synergistic interplay between high ranking pathogens and stressors (individually associated with population-level effects) to build a better understanding of factors that may be more than simply additive that if targeted for mediation, could dramatically improve survival.  As we can only control factors that are under human influence, knowledge of synergistic relationships between stressors will provide resource managers targets for remediation and if not mitigated, could be incorporated into models predicting return numbers.  Cumulative impacts modeling is anticipated to continue through the 2023-2024 fiscal year. Understanding of the cumulative interplay between stressors, stressors and disease, and interactions with prey availability/predation, will provide an ability to predict the impacts of reducing one, but not all stressors associated with survival.

2023-2024,2448,"Developing a proactive, modernized, holistic approach to ensure optimal health and condition of Hatchery Production",PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,"Kristi Saunders, Karia Kaukinen, Arthur Bass",Approved,"In years 1 and 2, a proactive holistic health monitoring approach based on high throughput molecular technologies was validated for utility in two salmon enhancement hatcheries, and is now ready in year 3 for minimally invasive application in hatcheries culturing conservation stocks, the objective from the start of the program. The technical approach revealed annual shifts in stress, infection, and timing of smolt readiness identified through salmon Fit-Chips, and eDNA analyses found the source water to be a major determinate of infections in hatchery cohorts. As such, future monitoring of pathogens in hatchery source water will be crucial to minimize infection potential and maximize post-release survival in stocks of conservation concern. Moreover, monitoring of water from natal watersheds where conservation stocks will be released is also critical to understand whether hatchery production may risk the introduction of pathogens not detected in those watersheds, and to guide mitigation measures, if necessary.

Overview of past and future approach:

Two modern molecular-based approaches have been successfully applied to assess shifts in holistic health of hatchery cohorts: 1) Salmon Fit-Chips applied to gill biopsy samples to assess stress, infection, disease, and smolt readiness, and 2) environmental RNA (eRNA) applied to source water coming into the hatchery and culture tanks/ponds to monitor presence and abundance of dozens of pathogens and parasites. After two years of validation at two enhancement hatcheries, these technologies are deployment ready for non-lethal application in hatcheries culturing stocks of conservation concern.

In 2022-2024, enhancement stock cohorts at Nitinat and Robertson Creek hatcheries were sampled bi-weekly/monthly over two years of production. A database to capture meta and molecular data, and scripts for semi-automated reporting were developed. Fit-Chip data revealed shifting levels of thermal and oxygen stress across hatchery cohorts in the first year, and no apparent stress in the second year. Viral disease associated with PSnV infection in gill tissue was associated with hypoxia stress and morbidity at one hatchery. Altering source water resulted in a shift in pathogen profiles in fish across hatcheries. In 2023, only 50% of Chinook reached full smolt status at the time of release, whereas over 90% of fish were full smolts at release in 2024 across both hatcheries.

In 2025-2026, a minimally invasive approach will be applied to up to 8 Conservation Hatchery Stocks cultured across 4-6 hatcheries, with SEP management making the final determinations of stocks that will benefit most from proactive health monitoring. Gill biopsies from all moribund fish and bi-weekly collection of water filters for eRNA will be collected by hatchery staff, with preserved samples mailed bi-weekly to PBS. water will be sampled both from tanks and source water into the hatcheries, as well, when possible, the water where conservation stocks will be released. This is critical to understand if there are pathogens that these stocks may pick up in the hatchery that are not detected in their natural environments. Hatchery staff will be provided training and sampling kits by January 2025. Molecular analyses of gill and water samples would be processed simultaneously for all participating hatcheries upon receipt, and bi-weekly reports sent back to hatcheries. Hatchery managers can use this information to address husbandry needs that minimize infection/stress and guide release timing to optimize post-release survival.

2023-2024,2451,Relative reproductive success of hatchery- versus natural-origin salmon in Canadian integrated populations,PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,"Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband",Submitted,"Enhancement of Pacific salmon through hatchery production is a key component of supporting wild salmon populations. Objectives of hatchery enhancement span conserving at-risk stocks, rebuilding lower abundance stocks, providing harvest opportunities and increasing public awareness through outreach and education. However, there are also risks associated with hatchery enhancement; differences between a hatchery and a natural habitat affect both the genetic and environmental factors that shape the performance and fitness of salmon. Consequently, hatchery-origin salmon may be less suited to wild habitats than their natural-origin counterparts, and the presence of hatchery-origin fish on a natural spawning ground may reduce the fitness of a population overall. The relative fitness of hatchery-origin compared to natural-origin salmon has been estimated in a handful of systems through determination of relative reproductive success (RRS). In these studies, returning adults are assigned back to their parents using genetic tags called parentage-based tags, and RRS is inferred by the number of returns per family from hatchery-origin compared to natural-origin parents. In general, the results of RRS studies suggest that hatchery-origin fish have lower natural reproductive success than natural-origin fish, and this reduced RRS is potentially transferred across generations. Despite this pattern, the extent to which hatchery-origin fitness is lower than natural-origin fitness is likely dependent on current and historical factors impacting specific systems, including hatchery practices. To date, no study has estimated the RRS of hatchery- and natural-origin Pacific salmonids in integrated populations enhanced by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). This is a critical knowledge gap for effectively managing hatchery production, as genetic management of these systems currently assumes a RRS of 0.8. This value is a reasonable consensus value from published estimates in USA rivers, but the SEP has had clear guidelines for genetic management since at least the 1980s, and it is possible that RRS estimates from USA hatcheries are inaccurate for SEP hatcheries. Utilization of an inaccurate RRS estimate could result in mismanagement of genetic risks associated with hatchery production, because the number of hatchery-origin fish that are predicted to utilize the natural spawning grounds increases as RRS increases, whereas a high RRS infers relatively low negative consequences for fitness associated with hatchery-origin spawners. Therefore, accurate estimation of RRS is important for effective genetic management of SEP hatcheries, particularly in the context of managing the influences of the hatchery and natural environments on the adaptive trajectories of integrated populations (i.e., proportionate natural influence or “PNI”). The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Initiate extensive genetic sampling of both the escapement and broodstock for at least one Pacific salmon population enhanced by the SEP (confirmed population: Sarita River Chinook Salmon). 2) Use a genetic biomarker panel to genotype these natural-origin and hatchery-origin parents. 3) Explore alternative approaches to enable widespread RRS estimation across SEP hatcheries even in systems where extensively escapement sampling is infeasible. The long-term objectives of the study are: 4) Explore options to increase sampling efforts to approach comprehensive escapement sampling in future years. 5) Continue these genetic sampling efforts to derive parentage-based tags for returning adults from both hatchery-origin and natural-origin production. 6) Estimate RRS in SEP hatcheries to allow improved management of genetic risks associated with hatchery influences.

2023-2024,2452,Genetic associations with age of return in male Canadian Chinook Salmon,PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,"Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband",Submitted,"Chinook Salmon display arguably the widest range of life history strategies of all Pacific salmonids. One important life history strategy in male Chinooks is to return after one fewer year in the marine environment than the earliest returning females. These early-returning males or “jacks” are relatively small, and participate in spawning by employing an opportunistic “sneaker” strategy to fertilize small numbers of eggs from many spawning events involving females and larger, more dominant, males. In general, spawning success in Chinook Salmon is closely related to size; however, jacks experience the risk marine predation for at least one less year than other males, and the success of jacks is a product of negative frequency-dependent selection. In other words, as the proportion of large males increases, the relative success of jacks increases, whereas as the proportion of jacks increases, the relative success of jacks decreases. In addition, from an evolutionary perspective jack males represent an important natural avenue of gene flow between different spawning years in Pacific salmon species. Therefore, the natural occurrence of low frequencies of jack males in Chinook Salmon populations is likely beneficial for the population and species as a whole. There are both genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the tendency of a male Chinook to return as a jack, and current understanding suggests that growth rates at early life stages combined with size-at-age thresholds play key roles in the likelihood of observing the jack phenotype later in life. These factors suggest that hatchery enhancement may artificially raise the proportion of jack males in a population, and this has been observed in some hatchery lines. Despite the importance of the jack life history strategy overall, there is no doubt that larger Chinook males are more successful on the spawning grounds, and larger salmon are more valuable to fisheries. Consequently, there are concerns that hatchery enhancement may shift the distribution of ages of return towards younger age classes with negative consequences for both harvest and population-level fitness. To mitigate the risk of shifting a population’s average age of return, hatcheries may manage jacks in broodstock differently than other males by preferentially retaining older males. The jack phenotype is known to be inherited to a reasonable extent, and thus this broodstock screening should counter the likelihood of overrepresentation of jack fathers in hatchery-origin offspring. However, as genetic and environmental factors impact the tendency to jack, broodstock management would be improved and facilitated if jacks among the potential brood could be screened specifically for the genetic factors underlying the jack phenotype; these factors are the most likely to directly impact the proportion of jacks in the subsequent generation of hatchery-origin offspring. Recent research has shown that specific y-chromosome haplotypes are strongly associated with the tendency of a male to return as a jack, but these haplotypes are unique to different regions. Y-chromosome haplotypes in Canadian Chinook Salmon have not be characterized in the context of ages of return for any population, impairing the ability to develop genetic tools to refine hatchery broodstock management. Therefore, resolving the genetic variants responsible for known inheritance of the jack life history strategy is an important step in improving genetic hatchery management in the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Identify males of known age classes from previously genotyped broodstock from three Chinook populations enhanced by SEP (confirmed populations: Chilliwack River Fall, Puntledge River Fall and Qualicum River). 2) Perform reduced-representation sequencing on 256 males from each population across age classes with approximately 80 jacks per population. 3) Analyze genotype-phenotype associations between genetic variants and the age of return among individuals, including a specific analysis of y-chromosome haplotypes. The long-term objectives of the study are: 4) Expand these analyses to include additional SEP-enhanced Chinook populations from other regions to confirm the generality of genetic associations. 5) Design genetic tools to allow rapid screening of genetic variants that have large effects on the tendency of a male Chinook to return as a jack. 6) Potentially expand these analyses to examine genetic associations with age of return in female Chinook, which would also support genetic management of SEP broodstocks.

2023-2024,2453,Epigenetic variation between hatchery- and natural-origin Canadian Chinook Salmon,PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,"Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband",Submitted,"Enhancement of Pacific salmon through hatchery production is a key component of supporting wild salmon populations. Objectives of hatchery enhancement span conserving at-risk stocks, rebuilding lower abundance stocks, providing harvest opportunities and increasing public awareness through outreach and education. However, there are also risks associated with hatchery enhancement; differences between a hatchery and a natural habitat affect both the genetic and environmental factors that shape the performance and fitness of salmon. Consequently, hatchery-origin salmon may be less suited to wild habitats than their natural-origin counterparts, and the presence of hatchery-origin fish on a natural spawning ground may reduce the fitness of a population overall. Despite the known risks and consequences of hatchery enhancement, major genetic differences between hatchery-origin and natural-origin salmonids as a result of hatchery-mediated selection or relaxed selection have generally not been observed in integrated populations. In contrast, substantial epigenetic differences have been detected between hatchery-origin and natural-origin Pacific salmonids. Epigenetic variants are structural changes to DNA without a change in the DNA sequence itself. For example, DNA methylation is a commonly studied epigenetic mechanism in which a methyl group (-CH3) is covalently added to a cytosine residue. These modifications to DNA can alter the function of the genome, particularly through the regulation of gene expression. Given the extent of variation in epigenetic signatures between hatchery-origin and natural-origin salmon, the functional effects of epigenetic variants are excellent candidates to underlie the fitness consequences associated with hatchery enhancement. Additionally, it is possible for hatchery epigenetic variants to be inherited by the offspring of hatchery-origin fish, which aligns with the potential for long-term reductions in population fitness as hatchery-origin fish spawn in natural habitats. The study of epigenetic variation in Pacific salmonids is relatively in its infancy, but epigenetic biomarkers are a promising tool to facilitate managing hatchery enhancement specifically and salmon fisheries generally. A critical knowledge gap in the generation of these tools is that epigenetic differences between hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook Salmon have not been well-characterized within enhanced populations or across populations enhanced by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). Therefore, a comprehensive examination of DNA methylation between hatchery- and natural-origin Canadian Chinook Salmon is a high priority, which will be followed by the development of epigenetic biomarkers and tools for monitoring and management. The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Identify hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook Salmon in broodstock from five SEP hatcheries through assignments of parentage-based tags (confirmed hatchery lines: Nicola River, Quinsam River, Sarita River, Atnarko River Upper, Chilliwack River Fall, Chilliwack River Summer). 2) Utilize enzymatic methyl sequencing to assess DNA methylation patterns among female and male hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook Salmon across difference age classes of return. 3) Determine hatchery-origin epigenetic variants that are: common across all hatcheries studied, specific to individual hatcheries, associated with physiological performance, associated with sex, or associated with age of return. 4) Identify candidate epigenomic biomarkers for use in high-throughput molecular tools to support monitoring and management decisions. The long-term objectives of the study are: 5) Develop high-throughput molecular tools to screen epigenetic biomarkers in Chinook Salmon (e.g. pyrosequencing, eDNA methylation sequencing) 6) Expand the regional coverage of hatchery lines assessed to confirm generality of hatchery-origin variants across SEP programming. 7) Fully assess and resolve regional and hatchery specific epigenetic differences between hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook Salmon to support high-resolution targeted monitoring efforts. 8) Investigate the temporal and environmental sensitivity of hatchery-origin epigenetic variants, and the extent to which hatchery-origin epigenetic variants occur across tissue types. 9) Examine the establishment of hatchery-origin epigenetic variants through stages of hatchery production. 10) Assess epigenomic patterns that could be used to indicate the age of hatchery-origin Chinook Salmon in SEP enhancement lines.

This part of an ongoing data rescue effort to capture, catalog, assess, and make accessible, as appropriate, the volumes of paper notes, intellectual property, and physical and digital copies of data generated by or otherwise linked to Dr. Kim Hyatt; these data have been inaccessible since his passing and require a knowledgeable party to evaluate, assess, compile and make available. These data include limnological data as well as fish abundance data. Data sources are in the late Dr. Kim Hyatt's files, which are stored in a variety of media, including hard copy printouts from defunct software, and electronic storage. The objective of this specific project is to compile historic juvenile Sockeye Salmon size, condition, abundance, and annual migration timing information, from associated raw data, for an estimated two dozen study-lake research projects directed by various DFO programs led by Dr. Kim Hyatt since 1977 (e.g., Lake Enrichment Program (LEP), Enhancement Assessment Unit (EAU), Juvenile Salmon Index Surveys (JSIDs). Raw and life-stage specific summary data will be compiled into a user-friendly database and made available to internal (DFO) and external organizations via the Open Data Portal. The database that will store these data will be searchable and will use optical character recognition (OCR) to rescue data without having to open and read each scanned or digitally retrieved file. Where OCR cannot assess hand written notes, the original scan is kept. The main objective is data rescue to preserve historic data that are at risk of loss. Specific deliverables include: i. A user-friendly menu-driven forms-based MS-Access relational database, with built-in queries for annual summary reports and export to other programs (e.g., Open Data); and ii. One or more Canadian Data Reports of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, with annual summary tables and plots for life-stage specific size, abundance, and migration timing details. iii) A variety of management questions may be addressed by having these data consolidated and preserved. These include (a) providing baseline data for evaluation of changes due to climate change, (b) providing baseline data for improving understanding of local ecosystems, and (c) providing Area managers with historical maximum and minimum salmon abundances within their Areas, from which it is possible to better determine escapement and harvest goals.

It is worth noting that this data rescue effort can facilitate other projects or work that would be dependent on these data such as the analyses of climate effects on salmon ecosystems over time, management of local populations of salmon (e.g., escapement targets, harvest quotas), Species at Risk work, Sockeye Index Stocks (Cam Freshwater), habitat improvement or remediation planning, and marine shipping disaster preparedness (e.g., provide spatio-temporal knowledge of sensitive salmon life stages during migration for Oceans Protection Plan).

The technology is already in use at a number of locations throughout southern and central BC (http://pacfish.ca/wcviweather). While specific site locations have not yet been identified, the general locations would include: i. Tahltan Lake (sockeye) ii. Tatsamenie Lake (sockeye) iii. Klukshu River camp (Chinook, coho, sockeye) iv. Taku River (3, locations TBD) (Chinook, coho, sockeye, chum) These installations would serve to provide year-round indicators of juvenile rearing conditions and long term changes of those conditions by collecting data on stream/lake discharge, water/air temperature and rain/snowfall.

The proposed sites are adjacent to areas of significant spawning and rearing activity and, in some cases, include areas with Treaty driven enhancement objectives (i.e. Tahltan and Tatsamenie Lakes) where rearing conditions are critical to the success of the programs.

Climate change drivers and the impact on salmon is still uncertain however it is apparent that those changes are occurring at a greater rate in northern areas. Remote areas in Northern BC and the Yukon are difficult to monitor throughout the year due to the remote and uninhabited nature of the sites and variables related to juvenile freshwater rearing conditions are largely unknown. Installation of these stations would enable long term tracking of freshwater conditions specific to salmon incubation and rearing.

2023-2024,2493,Improved understanding of cumulative impacts on salmon survival across freshwater life-stages; tools and approaches for mechanistic assessments,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,"David Patterson, Douglas Braun",Submitted,"Context: Landscape level assessments of stressors on aquatic habitats, climate change projections, and population dynamics models can provide cautionary flags that identify potentially stressed or vulnerable watersheds and/or populations (e.g., RPA status assessment, Pacific Salmon Explorer). These approaches are useful for initial watershed or population prioritization. However, in most cases these approaches are limited in their ability to accurately describe the cumulative impact that multiple stressors can have on individuals and specific populations because they lack a mechanistic approach that can verify the complex interacting pathways of effects on fish (Peacock, Braun, Hodgson et al., 2023). This complexity makes it difficult to understand how future landscape alterations and climate change will affect salmon in a given watershed; thus limiting our ability to provide specific advice to managers on how to predict which mitigation or recovery actions (e.g. habitat restoration, harvest reductions) will most effectively recover salmon populations. We propose to link in situ ecophysiology information with other biophysical habitat monitoring data to develop mechanistic relationships that address management issues around habitat-population modeling, assessment of restoration function, and fish responses to climate change. The specific management questions are: Q1) What multi-factor stressors limit stage specific freshwater habitat distribution? Q2) What are the key drivers of stage-specific survival and growth for life-cycle modelling? Q3) What is the role of temperature in combination with other key factors in predicting climate change impacts on salmon growth and survival in a given habitat (e.g. lake, river, wetlands)? Q4) What are major habitat factors that affect salmon growth and survival to consider in planning and assessment of habitat mitigation, restoration, and offsetting effectiveness? The proposal is to execute a series of projects that directly address these management questions through two main outcomes 1) improved understanding of cumulative effects, and co-development of 2) tools and approaches to guide future mechanistic assessments of cumulative impacts. Improve Understanding: For year 1 & 2, we propose to continue work on cumulative impact projects: 1) development of in situ stage specific mechanistic relationships among biophysical factors (dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, flow, conspecific competition), distribution, physiological condition metrics, growth, and survival for juvenile salmonids – all measure in situ, 2) continue to develop and evaluate ecophysiology tools related to evaluating fish condition. Life-stage specific mechanistic relationships will be examined using samples in-hand from three large scale field programs (Lakes, E-Watch, North Thompson Salmon Ecosystem Program) within the Freshwater Ecosystems Section. All three programs generate unique multi-year population data on multiple biophysical factors influencing juvenile salmon condition, growth, and survival such as, water quality, conspecific density, temperature, food availability, primary productivity, DO and water level in lakes, wetlands, and flows in rivers. Models examining the effects of multiple biophysical factors on condition will be used to understand how interacting biophysical drivers (including stressors) shape fish condition, while models examining relationships between condition metrics and growth and/or survival will examine the use of condition metrics as tools to indicate future salmon presence, growth and survival. Concomitant lab work is ongoing to support the development of ecophysiology tools, such as growth hormones (IgF) for freshwater salmon growth, troponin for oxygen stress, and triglycerides (TAG) for nutritional status, that can be used as potential indicators of habitat quality. For Year 3&4 we will use the results from year 1&2 to identify and test key knowledge gaps on cumulative effects in salmon (e.g. Iacarella proposal). This selection of multifactor field experiments could include: low DO and high temperature; food availability, temperature, and growth/survival; pH and temperature tolerance experiments with preference/avoidance behaviour studies; and temperature and migratory stressors on in-river survival Sockeye/Chinook/Coho. This project is distinct from related PSSI proposals in that we are proposing a mechanistic approach to test the cumulative impact of multiple factors directly on individual fish response (i.e. growth, survival, stress) in their native habitats, leveraging multiple program expertise both within the freshwater section and beyond. Our experience is that science advice to major management decisions are best supported by a mechanistic understanding how environmental and physiological processes directly impact fish themselves. This is foundational work that can then be used to generate population responses were appropriate. However, we acknowledge that not all management questions to science require such an in-depth experimental approach, which is why we are proposing the guideline development to help managers and researchers prioritize how best to approach assessing cumulative impacts, as well as work with the other related projects. The proposal is complementary to other PSSI science proposals in that we are addressing similar questions, but at different spatial scales (e.g. Iacarella’s broad region-wide scale) and biological levels of organization. The work also complements broad-scale modeled predictions of discharge, temperature, and DO, that can be used with our mechanistic relationships to generate robust predictions of fish responses to climate change. More specifically, we will help test some of key stressor interactions that emerge as pervasive across the province from Iacarells’s proposal with field-based studies. We will directly link the outputs from Naman’s model of habitat suitability with direct measures of fish condition, fish performance and survival (i.e. a form of cross validation). We will work with Czembor’s group to share ideas on the state of knowledge of key limiting factors, and evaluate fit-chips as a potential ecophysiological tool from the Miller proposal. Tools and Approaches: We will synthesize approaches and our results to develop a pragmatic guide for initiating mechanistic cumulative effects investigations. We started with a literature review (Y1-2) of current methods for assessing physiological condition, as an integrated measure of habitat quality. The review will examine the benefits and limitations of these different physiological condition metrics and span metrics that include genomic, transcriptomic (fitchips), proteins (e.g. hormones, enzymes), metabolites (TAGs, ions), and phenotypes (size). This verification of physiological tools will be done in conjunction with assessing different habitat monitoring and modelling approaches (e.g. Cunningham 2022; Naman proposal) to verify Value of Information. For Year 3 & 4\. The culmination of the literature review and field/lab projects will be a pragmatic guide for a tiered approach (i.e. opinions, reviews, observations, hypothesis testing, quantification of uncertainty) to initiate mechanistic cumulative effects investigations that directly link to management advice (Patterson et al. 2016). The guide can be used to develop in-depth monitoring programs where watersheds or populations are flagged by broad scale analyses as stressed or at risk (Iacarella proposal).

Particularly in fish however, the development of disease reflects not only infection but also interactions with environmental and host factors. Since 2003 we have been conducting intermittent annual surveillance of parasitic infections in spawning pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) at the Quinsam River hatchery. We have documented the prevalence and histological consequences of Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, the causative agent of proliferative kidney disease (PKD) in Quinsam River pink salmon. In addition, annual records of the number of salmon returning to the hatchery in addition to flow, temperature and other data for the Campbell and Quinsam Rivers, have been provided by the hatchery and BC Hydro, respectively. This combination of data provides an opportunity to assess the impacts of multiple interacting host, environment and pathogen factors on the productivity and survival of pink salmon at the Quinsam River hatchery. Of particular interest is T. bryosalmonae. The purpose of the proposed research is to expand the aforementioned research at the Quinsam hatchery through collections of infection and histological data from adult and juvenile pink, coho and Chinook salmon in 2023 – 2025. In addition to salmon population and abundance data, river conditions will continue to be characterized using data shared by BC Hydro.

Colder, more oxygenated waters can persist for up to 1 year in Bute Inlet after the outflow event, which could create a marine refugia. To understand whether this process impacts other fjord systems, a PhD student (Ehsan Tighizadeh) who is jointly situated int he Natural Resources and Environmental Studies Graduate Program at the University of Northern British Columbia and Fisheries and Oceans Canada will expand this study to cover the entire British Columbia coast. Specifically, they will reconstruct the historical climatology of Arctic outflow winds and their impact on fjord waters along the BC coast. Through this work, it is anticipated that other marine refugia created by Arctic outflow winds will be identified.

2023-2024,2539,Climate Downscaling for salmon conservation in Marine Ecosystems,PSSI (B-base),Climate Change and Oceans,"Di Wan, James Christian",Submitted,"The ocean environment determines year-to-year fluctuations in salmon productivity and is changing rapidly due to anthropogenic climate change. Oceanographers in DFO and other departments such as ECCC have collaborated in the development of ocean models that can be used to assess future changes in the environment for salmon and other fish species. However, there is a significant 'scale gap' between the global, coarse resolution Earth System Models used to generate climate projections and the high-resolution (e.g., 3 km) models used to downscale these projections for coastal and shelf environments. This gap can be filled by basin-scale models at 1/12 to 1/4 degree. The present research plans to build on existing efforts funded under CSRF to conduct simulations of projected future climates at these intermediate scales. In this way we will create an 'envelope of possibilities' of future environments for salmon in the oceanic environment.

The main anticipated outcomes from this work are (1) development of a capacity to downscale climate projections at intermediate scale, including biogeochemistry (e.g., oxygen concentration), and (2) generation of data products that can used for Species Distribution Modelling of salmon in the oceanic environment.

This followed earlier work on relations between ocean conditions and salmon migration (Thomson and Hourston, 2011). Specifically the forecasting involves establishing new and/or using existing statistical relations between both migration timing and pathway to the Fraser River from the open ocean and the variability of near surface ocean properties such as currents, temperatures, salinities, and possibly wind stress as a proxy for surface currents. Relations established over as many years as possible of observed salmon data and both observed and modelled ocean data with the ocean leading the salmon will allow forecasting salmon behaviour for the current year.

One pillar for the KMU lies in supporting DFO data producers and consumers create, share and access data resources. We do this using a data product perspective and examining how different data assets are managed through a data life cycle.

##### Identify pain points in terms of how data are brought into decision-making processes
Within a data life-cycle framing we examine where data pain points are most pronounced and work on ways to address them. In 2023-2024, we are:
- working with the Follow the Fish (FTF) projects to design data policies, guidelines and tools to enable cross-project sharing of data
- working with international groups to define salmon data mobilization best practices
- Working with PSSI to communicate data stewardship, governance and management needs that can be addressed in PSSI products

#####Digitization of paper data forms into digital records
Recording of field data on paper creates a significant backlog in the data process.  To learn how to remove this bottleneck and apply solutions  to present-day systems, we are 
- Develop proof of concept data digitization pipeline that can take paper forms and turn them into digital data records
- Extract historical environmental data from BC 16 documents
- Apply the processing pipeline to Stream inspection log documents
- Analyze results of data extraction to summarize environmental impacts on streams

#### Harmonizing divergent data processes
- Develop models for rich metadata that describe work processes undertaken by different people doing similar things in different ways
- Define structured vocabularies that help us determine when different processes are talking about the same things
- Use generative AI to support cleaning of existing metadata elements so they become rich metadata
- use clustering analyses to identify similarities or divergence between things that are or should be alike
- applying these methods to harmonization of Monitoring Methods metadata

#### Apply modern data management and processing tools to ecological concepts or DFO outcomes.
The tools and analyses we develop are intended to address generalized pain points, but still require some level of change management to achieve implementation.  This change management will only be motivated by compelling use-cases that speak to departmental priorities.  As such, our 'pipeline' projects have specific research questions we focus on to demonstrate value.  Departmental objectives we are focused on include;

2023-2024,2578,Scenario Planning: improving the adaptatability of Pacific salmon hatchery planning and implementation to current and future climate changes.,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Modelling & Decision Support,David Willis,Draft,"The problem: Climate change is creating a more volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world. How do hatchery managers move forward despite these uncertainties and overcome “management paralysis” in the context of climate change?

What is being proposed: We will use scenario plans to develop key insights into SEP/DFO that can better ensure hatchery planning and implementation is adaptable to current and future climate changes over the next 20 years. Year 1 will focus on a DFO internal process and plan for broader engagement in Year 2 with Indigenous knowledge and a broader range of experts.

Scenario planning enables organizations to embrace uncertainty by expanding their understanding of the plausible range of futures they may experience. Scenarios are meant to guide and inform organizations about potential future changes that will impact how they operate. These processes enable organizations to be better positioned to deal with unexpected threats, and take advantage of unexpected opportunities.

Scenario planning is a structured approach for defining plausible futures. This is a co-learning participatory process identified as a key way to advance climate adaptation within organizations and processes (Hare 2020). Expertise provided by DFO Science, SEP, Indigenous groups, and other Sectors will be integrated through this process.

Scenario planning identifies areas of high impact and low predictability within a system, and imagines future situations, termed scenarios, that could occur given the uncertainties identified. Large-scale driving forces that may push the future in different directions are identified and used to uncover potential future states. Scenarios provide a fresh perspective, and a new framework that can be used to encourage dialogue and strategic thinking on the challenges and opportunities we may face. It is a powerful tool for forcing us to challenge commonly-held assumptions and expectations, and abandon previously fixed ideas that may no longer hold true. Scenarios help by legitimizing a dialogue, challenging conventional wisdom, initiating widespread discussion, and creating the possibility of genuine transformation.

Participants in scenario planning processes identify and evaluate management options or adaptations that are robust to alternate plausible future scenarios. In this way, scenario planning can help managers understand where management strategies may need to change to prepare for the future. This work can also prioritize knowledge gaps and future science priorities.

Key Question: We will implement a scenario plan to develop key insights into SEP/DFO activities that can better ensure hatchery planning and implementation is adaptable to current and future climate changes.
Who: DFO science and hatchery experts, with additional input from other DFO resource management sectors including social scientists. 
Deliverables: This group will run through the five steps of scenario planning used to produce preliminary insights into the question above, and to provide a plan for a comprehensive process with external engagement in Year 2. 
A report will be produced that documents the results of scenario planning for each of the five steps described below. This report will provide the framework for the full scenario planning process in Year 2 and the base of a report that will be published as a DFO technical report of fisheries and aquatic sciences at the end of Year 2.

Scenario Planning includes 5 steps following Frens and Morrison (2020):
1.	Orientation to the problem: define the specific issue being discussed, goals, scope, and desired outcomes.
2.	Exploration: improve understanding of the issue, identify key drivers and uncertainties.
3.	Scenario building: identify critical uncertainties (drivers) for the scenario framework, develop plausible scenario narratives.
4.	Application: examine scenarios for implications, develop and evaluate management actions.
5.	Identify indicators: specifically, environmental indicators and thresholds that would trigger recommended management strategies .",,No,,,No,,No,,,,,No,,No,,,No,,,No,No,No,,,,,,

2023-2024,3118,Assessing the impact of modifications to hatchery release strategies of Chinook salmon on their distribution and marine survival.,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Chrys Neville,Submitted,"The Salmon Marine Interaction Program has been conducting large scale marine surveys of juvenile Pacific salmon in the Strait of Georgia for the past 25 years. The large geographic range of the surveys, surveys conducted in both early summer and fall, and the use of an unbiased sampling gear (trawl net), has allowed the surveys to examine specific stocks of Pacific salmon during their first marine summer and design studies to test hypothesis on factors regulating the survival during their marine residence. During this period of time the Program has worked collaboratively with SEP hatcheries on a number of questions associated with differences in hatchery and wild marine survival and based on preliminary results, possible strategies for increasing marine success of hatchery fish. This study is to complete the analysis, interpretation and reporting of two specific studies associated with Chinook Salmon that were initiated over the past six year but require completion of laboratory analysis for results and interpretations to be available to managers and other researchers.

Big Qualicum Hatchery (BQH) Chinook late release strategy. Collaboration and discussions between emeritus scientist Dr. Richard Beamish and SEP was the basis for the initiation of the experimental late release strategy of Chinook Salmon and Coho Salmon from a number of ECVI hatcheries. Although there was increased survival by the late release group for both species, this variable release was only continued for Chinook Salmon. Several hypothesis for the success of the late release groups were proposed including both top down and bottom up mechanisms, however, these hypothesis were not tested. The SMI Program initiated a study to test the bottom up hypothesis. Specifically, the hypothesis suggested that the late release fish had increased and rapid early marine growth that resulted in a shift in metabolism in mid-summer from growth to energy storage. This change in metabolism would result in higher condition of these fish entering their first marine winter and higher subsequent survival. These faster growing fish, would therefore, represent a larger proportion of adult returns. To complete this study, juvenile salmon were collected in the early summer and fall surveys and identified to BQR using a combination of CWT recoveries and DNA analysis. The shift to specific brood groups for the different release timing groups and PBT genetic analysis has allowed release specific groups to be identified in the past few years and has significantly increased the number of samples available for our analysis. Scales and otoliths are collected from the fish for examination of growth rates and muscle tissue is used to measure energy density using bomb calorimetry. Additionally, adult returns are sampled to examine the early marine growth of these survivors compared to the previously collected juveniles. The funding requested for this study will ensure completion of the bomb calorimetry analysis and interpretation for this study.

Increased Chinook Releases from Lower Fraser River (LFR). In 2019, hatcheries on the LFR increased releases with the expected outcome of providing additional Chinook Salmon to southern resident killer whales. The early marine distribution of these LFR Chinook salmon through their first marine summer is in the southern portion of the Strait of Georgia including both Canadian and US waters. The “footprint” of this stock directly overlaps with the distribution of Chinook Salmon originating from Puget Sound, an area that was also increasing releases of hatchery reared Chinook salmon. For the LFR stocks, there is no evidence of any large scale migration out of the Strait of Georgia prior to the fall. Due to the coverage of the SMI surveys in both Canadian and US waters and Juan de Fuca, this samples collected in the SMI surveys provide an ability to examine the impact of the increased releases and identify changes in abundance, distribution or condition. If the BQR study support the hypothesis that growth during this period is associated with total marine survival, any impact on the early marine growth of LFR Chinook Salmon through competition could impact total marine survival. Examination of juveniles from these stocks collected both prior to and after the increased releases will help interpret if the increased density had an adverse effect on their early marine growth and survival or if there was increased competition with other stocks due to changes in distribution.

Specifically, this study is requesting funding for an EG-02 technician (6 months) and a BI-02 biologist (10 months) to assist with completion of laboratory analysis and with the analysis and interpretation of results for publication. The technician will complete the energy density analysis of juvenile Chinook salmon from the fall 2017-2023 SMI surveys for both BQR and LFR Chinook stocks. The technician will also collect biological samples (otoliths and scales) from adult returning Chinook salmon in the fall of 2024 (BQR). The biologist will conduct spatial analysis by stock group for Chinook Salmon caught in the surveys between 2010 and 2023. The data analysis will include spatial analysis by stock group for juvenile Chinook Salmon caught in surveys between 2010 and 2023. Additionally, they will co-author primary publications associated with the two projects. It is anticipated that a subsample of otoliths will need to be analyzed to validate measurements on early marine growth estimated from scale patterns. This work would be done by experts in Alaska that routinely do this work for fish caught in their marine surveys.

The Pacific Region groundfish trawl fishery likely represents the largest source of Pacific salmon catch in a non-salmon directed commercial fishery. While all Pacific salmon species are prohibited in groundfish trawl and cannot be sold or traded, salmon bycatch in trawl fisheries experience high mortality rates and there have been no management measures in place to monitor or mitigate risks to stocks of concern. This sampling program was designed in collaboration between DFO Science, Fisheries Management, industry and monitoring service providers to provide accurate estimates of salmon bycatch by species in the trawl fishery and representative information on Chinook stock composition and indicator stocks.

### Objectives

Initial discussions led to the following four objectives being adopted to guide development of the program: 1\. Accurately estimate the catch in numbers of fish of each salmon species; 2\. Ensure sufficiently accurate and representative CWT sampling to quantify the fishery mortality for Chinook indicator stocks; 3\. Use genetic stock identification (i.e. DNA) where feasible to identify the stock composition of Chinook catch, including for populations that do not have CWT indicator stocks; and 4\. Estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of Chinook catch to determine when and where exploitation on stocks of concern may be occurring.

The program was initiated across for all option A groundfish trawl vessels in September 2022, and will be continued during the 2023/24 fiscal year.

Current sampling protocols are functioning well and appear to be achieving the desired outcomes in terms of accurately estimating catch numbers by species and representative collection of coded wire tag and DNA samples for stock composition estimation. The development of new management measures for salmon bycatch in the groundfish trawl fishery may lead to some changes to monitoring procedures, however, these are still to be determined.

Deliverables for the 2024/25 year are:
1. accurately estimate catch of salmon by species for the 2024/25 groundfish year using independent validation of all trawl salmon bycatch
2. estimate CWT recoveries for Canadian Chinook salmon exploitation rate indicator stocks based on representative collection of CWTs from salmon bycatch

2024-2025,2397,Identifying good practices for considering Indigenous Knowledge in Rebuilding Plan targets and stock assessment reference poi,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Modelling & Decision Support,Carrie Holt,Approved,"The goal of this project is to identify reference points and rebuilding targets for Pacific salmon by pairing Indigenous knowledge systems with Western science within a knowledge co-production paradigm. Knowledge co-production can be defined as “the process of bringing together two different knowledge systems, in true partnership and equity, to enhance, learn, and create new understandings on a specific topic.” (Ellam Yua et al. 2022).

Analytical methods for identifying limit reference points have been developed for Pacific salmon (DFO 2022a) based on Western science, but these have not considered Indigenous Knowledge which was identified as a gap within CSAS review (DFO 2022a, b). ‘Upper stock references’ (delineating ‘critical’ and ‘cautious’ zones of status) and rebuilding targets are components of the DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework and the Fish Stocks provisions under the Fisheries Act, but guidance on identifying them is currently lacking for Pacific salmon. The Fisheries Act further enables the consideration of Indigenous Knowledge in management, such as in the development of rebuilding targets and reference points, but there is limited/no precedents for this for Pacific salmon.

Pairing Indigenous knowledge systems and Western science in the development of reference points and targets is a step towards ensuring that rebuilding is inclusive of Nations’ ontologies, including their definitions for ‘healthy’ and ‘rebuilt’. First Nations have a precedence of knowledge that includes generations of place-based observations that cannot be recreated, or necessarily measured quantitatively. This project, partnered with the Ha’oom Fisheries Society, will explore how to include this alongside or within Western science ideas of status assessment and rebuilding. Methods will be co-created with First Nations partners; we anticipate that they will include a combination of interviews, facilitated discussions, literature reviews, and meta-analyses. In particular, we will identify what levels and attributes are considered ‘healthy’ or ‘rebuilt’ for salmon populations and where ‘serious harm’ is expected to occur, including life-history, distributional, and habitat characteristics.

The project will be co-led with the Five Nations (Ahousaht, Ehattesaht, Mowachaht/Muchalaht, Hesquiaht and Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations) that are represented by the Ha’oom Fisheries Society, with a focus on relationship building and addressing Indigenous needs and values. Bringing Indigenous knowledge systems and Western science together will lead to more equitable and inclusive outcomes, supporting the aims of reconciliation and furthering the capacity for Indigenous self governance. Achieving sustainability of salmon fisheries cannot be achieved through a Western scientific lens alone; incorporating Indigenous Knowledge Systems and a broader perspective on what is considered healthy and serious harm in salmon ecosystems will be essential. The costs in year 1 will be supported in part by Five Nations Funding through DFO’s Treaties and Reconciliation Agreements Program.

2024-2025,2398,WCVI Sediment Transport and Redd Scour Assessment,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Diana McHugh,Approved,"  1. West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschwatcha) populations declined precipitously after the 1990s. Survival rates for naturally spawning WCVI Chinook are now below replacement levels. In 2020, WCVI Chinook was listed as ""Threatened"" by Canada's Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife triggering the Chinook Rebuilding Plan and the marine and freshwater risk assessment (FWRA) processes. Results from the FWRA, highlighted that across the region the incubation life history phase was extremely data deficient. High incubation mortality can reduce productivity and limit the recovery of Chinook salmon populations. A small change in survival during this life history phase can have significant implications on production. Redd scour was identified as a high priority data gap in the indicator watersheds throughout WCVI. The purpose of this study is to evaluate redd scour, sediment transport, and hydrological conditions in three indicator watersheds in Area 23 and Area 24. This study will be important for developing a standard methodology to address this data gap, and for characterizing the scale of the issue. The results will be vital for developing indicators and benchmarks, and to inform restoration, enhancement, and rebuilding measures for WCVI Chinook.

  2. The outcomes of the redd scour study are to: A. Develop a robust methodology to measure redd scour that can be repeated in indicator watersheds across the region; B. Estimate what percentage of redds are scoured at different flow thresholds and how that impacts salmonid mortality during incubation; and, C. Understand what effect more frequent and higher peak flows in a changing climate will have on redd scour and salmonid mortality in the future.

The methodology for the study has three components: I. The installation of a hydrometric station that is calibrated to provide a continuous discharge record for Tranquil Creek and implement a pilot methodology in Tranquil Creek (completed 2022). II. Field surveys in spawning locations that includes cross-sections and sediment size measurements, and the installation of PIT tagged accelerometer scour chains at surveyed locations to measure redd scour; (planned for Sarita [externally funded] and Tranquil in 2023 and Bedwell 2024). III. Pairing bed disturbance data with a 2D hydraulic model to estimate the spatial extent of bed disturbance at a reach scale in key Chinook and chum spawning areas. (Planned for 2023 in Sarita [externally funded] and 2024 Bedwell).

  1. The results from this study will be important for characterizing the scale of the issue and will be vital for developing restoration prescriptions and can inform indicator development, enhancement, and rebuilding strategies in the region. In particular, for the Bedwell and Sarita Rivers, a rotary screw trap provides a total abundance estimate, which facilities that calculation of the egg-fry survival rate. Developing a relationship between over-winter egg-fry survival and redd scour and sediment movement, will be important for understanding the scale of the issue in watersheds across WVCI and the urgency needed to address this issue.

2024-2025,2399,Risk Assessment Method for Salmon – Development for Regional Implementation,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Modelling & Decision Support,Chrissy Czembor,Approved,"**(1) WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED**

Hyatt et al. developed the Risk Assessment Method for Salmon (RAMS) in 2010 to identify and prioritize factors that limit salmon production, both now and under climate change. It was adapted from existing DFO risk assessment frameworks and a risk assessment framework for fisheries in Australia, and provides a standardized and semi-quantitative method to integrate ecosystem data and expert opinion related to salmon survival across all their life stages. The resulting list of ranked risks identifies both high priority management needs and data gaps that require additional investigation.

RAMS has been applied in more than a half dozen watersheds for Chinook (ocean and stream type), coho, and sockeye to inform Recovery Potential Assessments under the Species at Risk Act and Rebuilding Plans under the Fish Stock Provisions of the Fisheries Act. RAMS continues to evolve toward a standard methodology flexible enough to assess risks at different scales and with various levels of data availability. Included in those methods are: Regional Salmon Information Tables that provide scientific information about freshwater limiting factors for all major life history strategies of Pacific salmon species; a deterministic Life History Model template completed using relevant population data; an Ecosystem (Habitat) Status Report template completed using existing habitat and ecosystem information; and a Risk Assessment Matrix template completed during a RAMS workshop, currently in Excel format.

Areas of improvement for RAMS have been identified to facilitate regional implementation. Several components will be addressed by the existing project team, but some are beyond the capacity and/or expertise of the team and are the purpose of this proposed work. These include: (A) updates to the Regional Salmon Information Tables. This resource has not been updated since inception and significant new science is available to maintain relevance. Inclusion of marine information is also necessary to understand the bottlenecks to salmon across all their life stages. And (B) a conversion from the Excel-based Risk Assessment Matrix template to an R program based on a relational database with an interactive user interface. The Excel-based template is functional but does not allow for visualization of the many ecosystem components that are aggregated to understand risk; complex analysis of relationships between indicators and limiting factors; or hierarchical meta-analyses of data gaps and risk across stocks to facilitate prioritization of monitoring and research. Conversion to a relational database with a user interface will allow for this functionality.

__(2) OUTCOMES: __

A updated, robust RAMS framework applicable for all salmon species structured for continuous learning and updating, that is user-friendly for DFO and non-DFO technical staff. Specifically, 1\. Updated Regional Salmon Information Tables by life stage and ecosystem unit, including indicators, benchmarks, and guidance for RAMS facilitators. Request is for two BI-02s to update through existing literature and engage with DFO and other scientists (e.g., Dr. Jonathon Moore’s lab at SFU, Institute of Ocean Sciences oceanographers) to facilitate addition of freshwater and marine indicators and information. The team will pilot the tables for use in rebuilding and recovery processes and update as needed. 2\. Updated Risk Assessment Matrix template from Excel to an R-based program and backend database. This will require specialized coding expertise either through hiring or contract.  
3\. Workshop(s) with relevant DFO staff will be used to scope the structure and functionality required. 4\. Updates to the RAMS methodology and support work will require 0.35 FTE (Full Time Equivalents) for a BI-03.

**(3) THE MANAGEMENT QUESTION(S) ADDRESSED**

RAMS will prioritize risks to salmon stocks across the 3 Hs of Habitat, Harvest, and Hatcheries by identifying management and mitigation options most likely to result in successful restoration and rebuilding, which will support decision making in each of the 3Hs. It will prioritize scientific research and monitoring to address key knowledge gaps and integrate knowledge across disciplines inside and outside DFO. RAMS will support and standardize the legislated requirements for rebuilding plans under the Fish Stock Provisions and Recovery Potential Assessments under SARA.

Infection with this bacterial pathogen can result in significant morbidity and mortality in cultured juvenile Pacific salmon most notably Chinook salmon. The current strategy for disease avoidance is screening brood stock to exclude eggs from highly infected brood females using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a predetermined positive-negative threshold optical density value. The current guidelines for control of BKD have significantly reduced the incidence of disease in both hatchery-reared juveniles and returning adult fish.

The Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP) has 16 years of ELISA data for many Vancouver Island and mainland Coho and Chinook stocks, providing thirteen 3-year cycle for Chinook and fourteen 3-year cycle for Coho salmon. In addition, SEP also has direct fluorescent antibody technique (DFAT) semi-quantitative prevalence pre-release data for many of the stocks with ELISA broodstock data. Epidemiological analysis of this data will provide valuable information for identification of potential explanatory variables for BKD prevalence in stocks of concern. Furthermore, the ELISA database can be linked to the Parental Based Tagging (PBT) database.

The objectives of this project are as follows: \- Analysis of the ELISA data to identify potential explanatory variables and magnitude of effect as hatchery level management measures. \- Use simulation to model effect of increasing the positive-negative culling threshold optical density value \- Analysis of the DFAT prevalence for yearling stocks prior to release to identify potential predictor variables. \- Link PBT data with ELISA data analysis from the first objective.

Long-term monitoring of IHNV infections across multiple stocks of sockeye salmon has revealed the prevalence of IHNV infections can vary annually within and between stocks; however, the factor(s) responsible for such fluctuations in IHNV prevalence in sockeye salmon stocks in British Columbia remain unresolved. Understanding the drivers behind the occurrence and perpetuation of IHNV in Sockeye salmon is instrumental in managing and mitigating the risk of this endemic pathogen.

Building upon work conducted through the Program for Aquaculture Regulatory Research, we’ll utilize epidemiological analytical approaches to study the patterns of IHNV occurrence across Fraser, Skeena and Columbia River Sockeye salmon stocks with the goal of identifying the factors which influence IHNV infection and disease in BC Sockeye salmon stocks. This will be achieved through three main objectives accomplished over a two year period: Objective 1: (Year 1) – Expand upon a long-term dataset of IHNV in Fraser and Skeena Sockeye stocks to include IHNV monitoring results of Okanagan River Sockeye salmon. In addition this comprehensive IHNV dataset will be populated with data detailing the enumeration of fish at various life stages, survival rates, and productivity for each of the corresponding Sockeye stocks. Where available, data concerning environmental and other potentially important variables gathered from other databases will be integrated into the new database to explore how these variables may impact pathogen prevalence.

Objective 2: (Year 1& 2) – Data verification and analyses to compare IHNV prevalence across the multiple Sockeye salmon stocks, evaluating similarities and differences both within and between stocks along with temporal and spatial variation.

Objective 3: (Year 2 & 3) – Use a mixed-effects analysis and ecosystem health approach to determine how changes in pathogen prevalence in wild sockeye populations relate to environmental and other potentially important factors and management measures in an effort to identify potential correlates with IHNV variability.

2024-2025,2402,Quantifying Yukon Chinook migration mortality and its implications for fisheries management and rebuilding under the Fish Stock Provisions of the Fisheries Act,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,"Brendan Connors, Adam O'Dell, Marc Ross, Yvette Hatcher",Approved,"Yukon River Chinook salmon have experienced declines in returns in recent decades culminating in four of the lowest returns on record in 2020-2023. These declines have put immense strain on the subsistence communities and Fish Nations that historically depended upon Chinook salmon throughout the Yukon River. They have also impacted the ability of the United States and Canada to meet escapement goals under the Pacific Salmon Treaty’s Yukon River Agreement, and are likely to have resulted in the Stock Management Unit, which is scheduled to be prescribed by regulation under the amended Fisheries Act in 2023/2024, to fall below its Limit Reference Point. In recent years large numbers (33%-52%) of returning Canadian-origin Chinook salmon have gone “missing” between sonar assessments at the mouth of the Yukon River and ~2000 km upriver at the border between Alaska and Canada. This has severely undermined the efficacy of fisheries management measures within the Alaskan portion of the river. A leading hypothesis for these missing fish is en route mortality due to heat stress (JTC 2020), which has been documented along with opportunistic observation of premature mortalities in Yukon River Chinook Salmon when spawning migration water temperatures exceed 18°C (Biela et al. 2020; 2022). However, direct estimates of en route mortality do not exist and a recent CSAS regional peer review (DFO 2022) identified the drivers and magnitude of en route mortality, and their consequences for management advice, as a critical uncertainty.

We propose to carry out a 3 year radio-telemetry project to quantify en route mortality of Yukon Chinook in relation to freshwater environmental conditions along their up to ~3000km migration from the mouth of the Yukon river to headwater spawning grounds. We will then use these estimates of en route mortality to evaluate the sustainability of the current aggregate escapement goal for Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook, and rebuilding potential of component Conservation Units (Connors et al. 2022) to inform analyses to meet the Fish Stock Provisions of the revised Fisheries Act for the Stock Management Unit. We are specifically seeking funding to extend radio-tracking infrastructure (towers and aerial overflights) into Canada to take advantage of an Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) project that will tag and track ~600 Chinook salmon in the Alaskan Portion of the Yukon River.

The management question being addressed by this project is: what is the magnitude of en route mortality in Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook and what are its consequences for international and domestic fisheries management, rebuilding potential, and integrated planning.

The specific outcomes of this project include:

  1. estimates of migration speed, timing, and en route mortality of Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook, by Conservation Unit and river section, in relation to freshwater environmental conditions; and

  2. quantitative evaluation of the consequences of a range of en route mortality (based on study) for the sustainability of alternative aggregate escapement goals and rebuilding potential.

2024-2025,2403,San Juan River Adult and Juvenile Assessment Program,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Katie Davidson,Approved,"The San Juan River is major watershed in southwest Vancouver Island (near Port Renfrew, BC) that supports distinct populations of Chinook, Coho and Chum, with Chinook enhanced annually at the 4 Mile Hatchery. The San Juan River empties into Port San Juan (PFMA 20-2).

Pacheedaht First Nation’s Salmon Stewardship Program conducts monitoring and restoration work in the San Juan-Gordon watersheds and estuary. Their work spans the salmon lifecycle and includes investigating impacts of redd scour on egg-to-fry survival, documenting juvenile salmon habitat use in the estuary, and conducting adult spawner surveys. Recently, they have also launched a pilot Chinook marking program with the 4 Mile Hatchery to reduce the impacts of hatchery genetics on the wild Chinook population through selective removals of adipose-clipped Chinook in terminal fisheries.

These activities will all inform the San Juan Chinook Rebuilding Plan in development by PFN, which will be linked to the broader WCVI Chinook Rebuilding Plan in development by DFO (required under the Fish Stock Provisions Act for naturally-produced WCVI Chinook, due March 2024) (DFO 2022; Minister of Justice 2022). However, the recent WCVI Chinook Risk Assessment process identified several knowledge gaps, mostly related to early freshwater and marine life cycle stages. For San Juan Chinook specifically, juvenile data from these life stages (and interactions between hatchery and wild juveniles) are sparse, and biological data on natural spawners (e.g., age, origin) are limited for Chinook.

These reasons make the San Juan River a good candidate to continue developing an integrated life history monitoring program in alignment with the larger Follow The Fish program. We propose to focus on the key work activities identified in Years 1 and 2 of the program, specifically those that complement Pacheedaht’s established juvenile monitoring programs. First, we will continue the rotary screw trap program to enumerate and sample naturally-produced out-migrating juveniles (all species, but focused on juvenile Chinook migration timing), allowing us to compare natural migration timing to hatchery release timing and to gather baseline biological traits relative to hatchery releases (e.g., size, condition). Otolith and stomach samples are also collected from a sub-sample of individuals to assess size-specific survival and diet contents. In Year 2 (2024), we developed a mark-recapture to obtain a relative abundance estimate for naturally-produced juvenile Chinook, and plan to implement this more thoroughly in Year 3 (2025). Second, we will conduct biweekly purse seining in Port San Juan through the late spring, summer and fall months (~May-October) to collect mixed-stock information, including hatchery/natural-origin of juvenile Chinook, stock ID, biological traits, relative abundance, and information on other species schooling with Chinook (e.g., Coho, Pacific Herring). As with the RST program, we will also be collecting otoliths and stomach contents from a sub-sample of Chinook encountered. Finally, we would like to develop a biosampling plan for naturally-spawning Chinook. We currently rely completely on broodstock sampling to assess adult spawner age and origin, but need to collect samples from natural spawners as well to ensure broodstock samples are not introducing any age- or stock-specific biases. This is critical for monitoring the Proportion of Natural Influence (PNI) for San Juan Chinook and to have an accurate representation of age-at-return to assess productivity trends.

We focus on Chinook due to the reasons mentioned previously (e.g., Rebuilding Plans) and for linkages to other programs currently funded under PSSI Pillar 1.1 such as Follow The Fish (DM Apps Project ID 2407), Ecological Indicators (DM Apps Project ID 2414) and Redd Scour Work (DM Apps Project ID 2398). The budget for Year 3 reflects costs for expanding the core field activities from Years 1 and 2, such as longer RST and purse seine seasons based on Year 2 Chinook catch results. Sample processing is also a key focus of Year 3, and the budget reflects the need to process biological samples such as genetics and stomach contents. It also includes technician time to support not only San Juan work but also Ecological Indicators and occasionally Follow The Fish (we plan to share technician resources among all projects as much as possible). Continued technician support is critical in order to meet reporting deadlines for PSSI Pillar 1.1.

By combining these key activities with PFN’s existing programs, we can obtain information from almost all stages of the Chinook life cycle, from adults to eggs to early marine juveniles. PFN employ a team of highly skilled technicians and biologists, and are well placed to eventually lead much of this work in future following this brief period of investment, capacity building, and project development supported by DFO.

2024-2025,2404,"Improving baseline knowledge of environmental conditions in Vancouver Islands fjords through observations and modelling, with a focus on hypoxia dynamics, climate change, and the potential implications for Pacific salmon",PSSI (B-base),Climate Change and Oceans,Laura Bianucci,Approved,"This project supports ongoing observational and modelling work in the fjords of the west coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI), with the goal of better understanding oxygen dynamics in this region. Modelling work started in fiscal year 2021-22 and main deliverables (a coupled physical-biogeochemical model of WCVI, south of Kyuquot) are expected by the end of 2023-24. A small observational component started during 2021-22 and has grown in scope every year. Through PSSI, we have two main goals: to create a monitoring program for Clayoquot Sound in 2023-24 (that will ideally extend to 2025-26) and to support and extend modelling efforts in the WCVI.

Specifically, we propose the following: a. Establish a Clayoquot Sound Monitoring Program in collaboration with the local First Nations (FN) and other organizations (Hakai Institute and Nature Trust of BC). Talks with all involved parties started in 2022-23; the plan is to provide training and equipment to the FN so they can use their vessels to perform monthly conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sampling throughout Clayoquot Sound (45 stations). These observations will support ongoing modelling work and will provide an important baseline of environmental conditions (including oxygen) throughout the year. This baseline is needed to understand the present-day environment experienced by migrating Pacific salmon. Without this baseline, it will be difficult to assess the effects of climate change in salmon populations and migrating routes.

b. Hire a term PC3 to contribute to the progress of the coupled physical-biogeochemical model for the west coast of Vancouver Island. In particular, this PC3 will lead the simulation of future scenarios and will act as a liaison with salmon experts, to ensure that the outputs of our simulations are useful for population distribution modelling and other salmon-related projections.

c. Hire a term EG4 to contribute towards DFO-led fieldwork in the WCVI inlets as well as data processing and management. For instance, technical support is needed for the development/improvement of weather stations and the maintenance of the weather station network (their data are crucial for forcing the surface of coastal ocean models), as well as for support with mooring deployment/servicing and opportunistic CTD sampling (e.g., while servicing weather stations). Furthermore, the EG4 will be needed to manage the inflow of data from the Clayoquot Sound Monitoring Program.

Management questions: Near-surface hypoxia (as shallow as 12 m) has been recently identified in Herbert Inlet, Clayoquot Sound (Rosen et al., 2022, doi:10.3389/fmars.2022.1000041). The historical record in the region is sparse, but it suggests that shallow hypoxia is found occasionally in this inlet. Are salmon runs affected by low-oxygen conditions near the surface in the fjords? Do these shallow hypoxic events constrain/restrict salmon habitat during their migration? Are these shallow hypoxic events increasing in frequency or can they be predicted in any way? (e.g., more common during marine heat waves or during positive/negative ENSO years, etc.). In order to address these questions, as well as the more generic question “What is the environment that salmon encounter during their migration into and out of the rivers, i.e. while they swim through fjords?”, we need to establish a monitoring program throughout the fjords of interest. A consistent sampling program in the next few years will create the baseline from which we will be able to assess future changes; and a monitoring program that continues in the future will make sure we can identify any climate-related change in the fjords’ environment. Furthermore, by combining observations and high-resolution (tens of meters) ocean models, we will be able to understand the mechanisms that drive oxygen (and other – e.g., acidification) conditions in the inlets, and predict how these will be impacted by a changing climate. The modelling work proposed here for the WCVI will allow for the first study of the impacts of future conditions in these fjords.

2024-2025,2405,Biological models to support prioritizing salmon stocks under future climates,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Modelling & Decision Support,"Brendan Connors, Cameron Freshwater, Josephine Iacarella, Patrick Thompson",Approved,"There is widespread recognition that Pacific salmon populations will be heavily impacted by climate change. These impacts are, however, expected to vary in space and time as well as across species and life stages. As a result, quantifying stock-specific risks of environmental change is critical for prioritizing DFO management actions. We propose to develop a data-driven analytical framework to quantify functional responses to climate variables across the salmon life cycle and make projections for how stocks will respond to climate change. Our approach will be sufficiently flexible to incorporate information from stocks that span a broad range of data quality.

Our multi-year proposal involves two components: In component 1, we will pair existing data on Pacific salmon population dynamics with readily available freshwater and marine environmental data to estimate the effect of variables such as temperature, flow, and food availability on salmon productivity (e.g. recruits per spawner). We will quantify life stage-specific effects on survival for stocks, including those with estimates of both juvenile and adult abundance. The focal stocks for initial modeling of data-rich stocks will be determined in year 1, with the goal of including stocks representing different species, geographic areas and status assessments relative to Wild Salmon Policy benchmarks. Ultimately, we will develop a hierarchical modeling framework which will allow us to leverage relationships in data-rich systems to estimate effects on data-limited stocks. In component 2, we will couple this modelling framework with downscaled climate models to project stock-specific responses under future climate scenarios. The projected biological status of different stocks, and associated uncertainty in them, will provide a scientifically defensible foundation upon which management interventions can be prioritized.

We are requesting funds to hire two term Research Scientists to develop the modelling framework. We expect that if only one RES were funded (or one RES and a BI2) that they could develop an initial model and demonstrate its application to a small number of case studies. However, to achieve the goal of developing a data-driven framework that is ready to be applied to stocks throughout the Pacific region, including those with medium or low data availability, two RES positions are necessary. Although the two researchers would work collaboratively, one position is focused on fitting models to estimate functional relationships for data-rich stock while the other will use simulations to develop methods for leveraging information from data-rich stocks to data-poor and provide decision criteria for broader implementation.

The proposed collaboration, involving a geochemical oceanographer (SJ) and biological oceanographers from Canada (AS) and the United States (CK), will permit a multidisciplinary approach to the research question. The project leverages existing samples, data and monitoring programs. It combines data from new and existing sediment and seawater samples with a trend analysis of archived taxonomic data. It will expand the geographic and temporal overage of existing data, while adding new biomarker analysis (sterols and fatty acids). It is crucial for managers to understand the causes of trends and variability in salmon populations in order to set catch limits.

2024-2025,2407,Follow the Fish: An integrated Chinook salmon assessment and monitoring program for the West Coast of Vancouver Island,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Jessy Bokvist,Approved,"Follow the Fish (FtF), is an overarching research program being developed to provide urgently needed information for effective conservation and rebuilding of West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook salmon populations. WCVI Chinook are listed under bill C-68 and are threatened by local extinction and poor marine survival, with high mortality thought to occur during the early marine phase. Through the recent multi-stakeholder WCVI Chinook Salmon Marine Risk Assessment (MRA) process multiple data gaps were identified for potential factors that contribute to poor early marine survival. Many salmon surveys have been conducted over the years, but few have been able to access shallower areas within the sounds off the West Coast, where ocean-type Chinook may reside for up to their first year at sea. Characterizing environmental variables of these nearshore ecosystems in addition to the health and condition of residing Chinook salmon is critical to understanding which factors may be limiting survival. To address data gaps, in 2020 a highly collaborative assessment program in nearshore areas within Sounds on the WCVI was piloted to capture juvenile Chinook salmon in their first winter at sea using microtrolling technology. Building on the successful implementation and collaboration in this program, FtF aims to expand the assessment and monitoring of WCVI Chinook both spatially and temporally to track fish throughout their first year of life and identify limiting factors related to growth and size-specific survival. The FtF program will focus on assessing Chinook salmon originating from Stamp River, Sarita River and Nitinat River populations in Barkley Sound as indicators of WCVI Chinook. Stamp River is an existing indicator for WCVI Chinook, and existing programs and infrastructure can enable relatively high rates of juvenile captures across the early marine phase. Previous microtrolling efforts have demonstrated these populations are detected in nearshore areas throughout WCVI Sounds over the winter through capture of hatchery and wild fish. Although these populations are predominately hatchery origin fish, contrasts will be made, where possible, between wild and hatchery fish to understand how factors limiting survival and growth may differ. Salmon will be captured at multiple time points throughout their life cycle including in the Nitinat River Hatchery and Robertson Creek Hatchery, in-river (rotary screw trap and/or beach seining), in estuary (beach seining/purse seining), and in nearshore marine environments (purse seining/microtrolling). At each time point, individual fish will be sampled to assess health and condition (infectious agents, Fit-Chip gene expression profiles, stomach contents, contaminants, lengths, weights, and clinical signs) and stock of origin, paired with environmental data including physical oceanography (temperature, oxygen, pH salinity, fluorescence) and biological oceanography (chlorophyl, zooplankton). Scale samples from individual fish will be used to compare relative rates of growth, based on circulus spacing, across life stages and populations to assess the impact of health, condition and environmental factors. Otolith samples taken concurrently will be used to assess relative size-specific survival across time points and populations. This can be achieved by characterizing the fork length to otolith radius relationship for smolts at ocean entry and then using otolith microchemistry for individuals who survive to subsequent time points. Broad distributional trends in how WCVI Chinook migrate will be investigated with microtrolling by capturing Northward migrating Barkley origin fish in Clayoquot, Nootka, Kyuquot and Quatsino Sound. Chinook intercepted during microtrolling that are not of Sarita, Stamp or Nitinat origin will be similarly sampled for comparisons. Many current departmental research programs are collecting datasets on salmon populations and their ecosystems that can be incorporated into the FtF program for a comprehensive assessment of factors limiting survival of WCVI Chinook. FtF is in discussion and working alongside both internal and external collaborators to ensure datasets are integrated into FtF (see project linkages). Existing DFO datasets from researchers across branches will be synthesized alongside relevant datasets produced by external collaborators. Throughout our FtF project timeline, we aim to incorporate relevant datasets through new collaborations and outreach. This approach will highlight data gaps that are not currently being addressed through either departmental or external research groups and future research avenues. Data outputs from this program will directly contribute to the WCVI Chinook rebuilding plans and will be distributed across to project collaborators for use in their programs. Knowledge on differential size-specific survival both across the early marine phase and between wild and hatchery stocks will have impacts on SEP management decisions for hatcheries and may inform harvest strategies for WCVI Chinook populations. Characterizing differential growth across the early marine phase will have important implications for restoration activities (e.g., limited prey availability) and stock management e.g., (mitigating impacts on periods and areas of critical growth). Overall, data outputs can be incorporated into pre-season and in-season forecasting and other WCVI Chinook models.

**Objective 2. Modernization of the Finfish Diagnostic Laboratory at PBS resulting in increased diagnostic testing capacity.** 
In year 2, technology transfer of the bench validated molecular assays to the FDL will be done. The AAH section at PBS has significant expertise and experience in running high throughput, validated diagnostic assays under rigorous quality control and assurance guidelines. Building on this expertise, AAH staff on this project will work with FDL staff to implement these workflows. This will take place over several stages to ensure a smooth transition and avoid erroneous results. Briefly, FDL staff will run the validated assays using training sample sets with known results. Staff will then be required to run the assay on a sample set to which they are blind to the sample identities. Upon successful identification of the samples, FDL staff will be deemed competent to perform the assay.

2024-2025,2409,Convergent tracks: a tagging study to quantify salmon predation by sea lions,PSSI (B-base),Pinnipeds,"Strahan Tucker, Cameron Freshwater",Approved,"The abundance of many Pacific salmon populations has remained below management reference points for decades despite large reductions in exploitation rates. A common paradigm is that poor marine survival has constrained recovery; however, the mechanisms (e.g. predation vs. starvation) leading to mortality and at which life stages they operate remain unclear. One specific hypothesis is that large aggregations of Steller sea lions intercept Fraser River sockeye salmon (10 of 24 CUs threatened or endangered (COSEWIC 2017)) north of Vancouver Island during return migrations. Yet little is known about sea lion foraging behaviour and diet in these remote transitions zones between offshore and coastal areas and even less is known about salmon mortality rates. Our proposal outlines a field program to addresses salmon and pinniped components simultaneously. This work will employ leading edge technologies to generate hard data on sources of salmon mortality and specifically the degree of pinniped mortality, moving us/debate/issue beyond the realm of conjecture and inference. Although this document describes a sockeye salmon-sea lion field program, we emphasize that our proposal is modular in that one or both species components can be pursued, and the framework could focus on alternative pinniped species, salmon species or salmon life stages based on departmental priorities (e.g. harbor seal impacts on juvenile Chinook salmon); however the costs associated with tagging juvenile salmonids will be considerably higher.

We will estimate sea lion predation on adult sockeye salmon as they migrate past Triangle Island, off the northern tip of Vancouver Island. This region is the site of the largest Steller sea lion rookery in the world and is hypothesized to be a survival bottleneck that disproportionately impacts Fraser River sockeye salmon productivity (e.g. Walters et al. 2020). Salmon-related work would quantify predation impacts via multiple complementary tagging technologies. After capturing sockeye salmon via purse seine near Haida Gwaii, we will use satellite tags to quantify guild-specific predation rates (e.g. cetacean, pinniped, shark) based on depth and temperature sensors, to generate high resolution estimates of salmon habitat use, and to estimate diversion rates that may moderate predation impacts (i.e. migrations through Juan de Fuca rather than Johnstone Strait). We will leverage existing acoustic telemetry infrastructure in the northern Strait of Georgia, that will increase the precision of mortality rate estimates at relatively low cost. Pinniped-related work will include complementary methods (fatty acids, stable isotopes and scats) to estimate diets at multiple temporal scales along migration pathways on either side of Vancouver Island. Pinniped diet analyses will be complemented by satellite tagging to understand movements, distribution and foraging behaviour in relation to salmon mortality locations. We wish to emphasize that these pinniped data will be highly relevant for gauging predator impacts more broadly, Including other PSSI initiatives.

For the salmon component, Y1 (FY 2023-24) will be a ramp-up period, with tagging occurring in Y2 and Y3. For the pinniped component, diet collections will begin in Y1 and continue through Y3. We will undertake initial satellite tagging of pinnipeds in Y1 to refine effective protocols and increase tagging rates in Y2 and Y3. Analytical pipelines for both components will be developed in Y2 so that final analyses can begin in Y3 and continue through 2026 (PIs have the capacity to complete analytical work without additional staffing). Unfortunately salmon tagging will occur during off cycle years; however we anticipate sufficient numbers of fish will be available to meet our sample size requirements.

Ultimately data on survival rates and predation are critical to several management questions. First, total survival rates can provide strategic information on whether specific life history stages are likely to constrain recovery (i.e. if survival is high then subsequent efforts should focus on other stages). Second, information on guild-specific predation rates can provide information on the utility of targeted management actions (e.g. fisheries, culls). These data are also key inputs to ongoing life cycle and ecosystem modeling efforts intended to guide prioritization of Pacific salmon stocks for rebuilding.

We have made additional requests to that amount in the 24/25 budget and have highlighted these below.

Although the project was conceptually endorsed, the amount received in Y1 could not support both a tagging and diet component for sea lions if carried forward in Y2. In fact, the allocation only supports some collection and analysis of diet samples (approximately 150 each for scat sample analysis and biopsy sample analysis). However, it has become apparent that costs for field collections were initially and unknowingly understated, particularly in accessing the remote site of Triangle Island-a pivotal site to address the hypothesis underpinning the project. Similarly, to meet field and sample processing objectives, technical help was underestimated.

A tagging component of the project, in addition to the diet work, would fully engage our BI-02, Chad Nordstrom. Chad is a highly specialized and skilled indeterminant employee within the Pinniped Program, but his position is not permanently funded; competitive sources are required. We are proposing to increase the allocation in the current budget from 50% FTE to 100% FTE with the caveat that we are also seeking to secure this portion from other competitive funding sources.

There are no published data outlining foraging pressure of Steller sea lions in BC. To address this gap, during the spring period, 10 animals of mixed sex and age (adult and sub-adult) will be targeted at Triangle Island each year. Steller sea lions will be instrumented concurrently with 2 types of satellite relayed data loggers: back-mounted tags (SPLASH) will provide data on fine-scale foraging movements during the spring-summer period until they are shed during the annual fall moult, while flipper-mounted tags (SPOT) will provide multi-year information on haul-out behaviour. These complimentary data streams will allow us to meet two major objectives: 1) defining sea lion foraging behaviour within salmon movement corridors during peak return migration; 2) deriving new haul out correction factors required for accurate population assessment prior to the 2025 international aerial surveys for the eastern Pacific stock of Steller sea lions. Both these elements will be crucial to delineate Steller foraging pressure on salmon. **NOTE the double tag deployment of 10 individuals as presented is the ideal scenario, but could consider other deployment scenarios which would impact the budget**

For a 1st year of sea lion satellite tag deployments, the Pinniped Program already has in its inventory 10 splash tags ($8K each) and 2 SPOT flipper tags ($2.6K each). This represents an **in-kind contribution of ~$85K** towards this component. Right now, we are purchasing 8 SPOT tags with PSSI funds (~$15K) to have a full complement of tags for 2024 deployments. We are seeking additional funds ($234,000) to account for higher field costs and support tag-related field work as well as the purchase of tags for a second year of deployment.
•	We require a total of $50K to support all field costs associated with tag deployments and multiple diet collection trips. Current allocation is $20K. Therefore, we are requesting an additional $30K
•	We are requesting a **maximum** of $111K for tag and supply purchases in Y2 for deployment in Y3. Costs can be modified based on numbers of the two types of tags: splash tags ($8K each) and SPOT flipper tags ($2.6K each)
•	We are requesting $20K for ARGOS fees (would scale with tag choices)

In British Columbia (BC), many salmon stocks have been assessed as at-risk by COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada), but while climate change has been increasingly considered in salmon management and policy, the threat posed by AIS has largely been ignored. Further, stressors like increasing global temperatures are out of the control of regional management while AIS can be managed locally. By targeting AIS most likely to have the biggest impact on salmon survival or productivity, we can improve salmon recovery by reducing the stress that these invasive species cause. AIS impacts on salmon are well documented in the US Pacific Northwest where, for example, invasive Walleye consume up to 2 million smolts a year in the Columbia River (Sanderson et al. 2009). The expansion of Northern Pike in Alaska has led to the decline of salmon productivity in some regions and all five salmon species have been classified as highly vulnerable to pike invasion in at least part of their Alaskan range (Jalbert et al. 2021). Habitat alteration can also impact salmon: Schwoerer et al. (2019) estimated the potential for $159 million annual damage to the Alaskan Sockeye salmon industry from one invasive plant species, Elodea. However, the extent and relative impact of freshwater AIS threats to salmon habitat and productivity have yet to be assessed in BC. Here we will fill this gap.

These acute stressor events are predicted to increase in both duration and frequency due to climate change (Frölicher et al., 2018). The proposed project will examine the impacts of warming and upwelling events (with acidified water) on the nutritional status of Limacina helicina, a cold-water pteropod that serves as an important dietary item for juvenile Pacific salmon species in the Northern Pacific (Brodeur et al., 2007; Doubleday & Hopcroft, 2015; Sturdevant et al., 2012). For example, dietary analyses of juvenile pink salmon and sockeye salmon within the Gulf of Alaska have shown a predominance of L. helicina (Brodeur et al., 2007; Doubleday & Hopcroft, 2015; Sturdevant et al., 2012). Research has demonstrated that shell development, growth, and survival of L. helicina are all highly susceptible to warming and ocean acidification (Manno et al., 2017), but there has been limited investigation of impacts to pteropod nutritional quality (i.e. composition) under the context of acute stressor events. Prey nutritional quality is a key aspect of feeding ecology that directly contributes to the survival of higher trophic species (Ahlgren et al., 2005; Daly et al., 2010). In salmon, variation in invertebrate prey quantity and quality may influence growth and survival, especially during early marine residence (Litz et al., 2019). Altered dietary lipid levels, for example, have been linked to changes in fish growth, fat deposition, and digestive enzyme activity (Pelusio et al., 2021). Consequently, we propose that any change in the nutritive status of L. helicina under climate stressor conditions could have carry-over impacts to juvenile salmon growth, health, and survival.

However, there are a multitude of non-fishing threats facing BC salmon that have not been fully identified nor characterized including Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS), harmful algal blooms (HABs), disease and pathogens, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals, etc. Further, many of these stressors can interact such that the cumulative effect of these stressors is likely greater than the sum of individual stressors. However, these stressors are unlikely evenly distributed across the Pacific such that different stocks will face different stressors and may respond differently. Thus, spatial and stock considerations will be critical. Finally, these stressors are affecting BC salmon at different life history stages across the freshwater, estuarine, and marine systems they utilize to complete their life cycle with climate change exacerbating the problem. By developing a decision support framework it will be possible to identify and characterize the individual and multiple stressors affecting salmon productivity or recovery in a standardized way among Pacific salmon stocks. This will allow managers to better incorporate and mitigate these non-fishing stressors most impacting salmon in decision making. Not only will this conveying a more complete understanding of stock status and threats to industry, stakeholders, and First Nations it will facilitate the inclusion of this information in fisheries management plans and SARA recovery plans. Further, this approach will allow targeting limited resources to those stressors that can best be managed with a clearer understanding of how salmon may be expected to respond when these threats are mitigated.  
Based on the non-fishing threats identified in the previous year, along with their expected impacts on BC salmon stocks, we will develop a geospatial dataset of these threats that can then be attributed to individual stocks. By developing an interaction matrix it will be possible to specify the stock-specific threats facing BC salmon and clearly indicate which management decision making processes need to include this information (e.g., fishing plan, recovery plan).

At the Nov 2022 workshop our breakout group identified a number of known stressors and in some cases we were able to identify specific threats to salmon. However, we had a much longer list of potential stressors for which we did not have subject matter experts. Thus, the first step will be to hire a dedicated BI-02 who will undertake a literature review, including Fisheries Management Plans, CSAS Advisory Documents, SARA Recovery Potential Assessments and Recovery Plans, to identify a range of non-fishing stressors affecting salmon and how DFO currently considers/doesn’t consider them in decision making. The second step will be to talk to subject matter experts both withing and outside DFO to fill information gaps that are identified during the initial review. This preliminary list will then be used in the third step, targeted workshops, where the experts will work to identify the causal mechanisms behind these stressors (e.g., life history stage affected, type of impact, duration, intensity, magnitude, recovery, etc.) and how they can be better considered in DFO decision making. This dual approach of literature review and expert opinions has been used previously to identify stressors impacting kelp recovery in the Salish Sea (Hollarsmith et al. 2022).

Based on the results of the first two years of the project, the third year will specifically develop decision support tools that will aid managers in how best to incorporate non-fishing threats across an array of DFO management and policy decision making processes, including, but not limited to Fisheries Management, SARA recovery planning, SEP restoration activities, and FFHPP integrated planning processes. Further, by developing this in conjunction with First Nations, it will expand on existing DFO’s efforts on Reconciliation.

Regular monitoring of harmful algal biotoxins in BC coastal waters since 2020 (Ross and Mueller, 2024) has revealed significant correlations between climate variables (e.g. water temperature) and the concentrations of these toxins in areas known to be frequented by Pacific salmon, including WCVI Chinook for which harmful algae have been identified as a high future risk (PSSI Risk Assessment Workshop #3). The goal of this project is to build upon our Biotoxin Monitoring Program (DFO Fieldnote OSDOEB_10) by adapting established analytical methods and procedures to measure harmful algal biotoxins in Pacific salmon, their prey and habitat. This information will be combined with environmental and taxonomic (plankton) data, and assessments of the health and condition of sampled fish, to help predict the effects of climate change and related processes on the exposure of Pacific salmon to these toxins, and potential impacts on their health and survival.

These feeds are not formulated for Pacific salmon, which require a specific balance of nutrients and other diet constituents to assure egg and juvenile quality, parr-smolt transformation and subsequent performance in seawater (Hanson et al. 2016, Perry et al. 2006, Jutfelt et al. 2007), as well as to limit the stress response following seawater introduction (Herrera et al. 2019). To this end, we propose to formulate and test new diets specific for the production of Pacific salmon, especially Chinook and coho, optimized to SEP hatcheries.

The data collected in Year 1 will help us to select diets for use in feeding trials to be conducted at SEP facilities rearing Coho and Chinook salmon in Years 2 and 3. Collectively, these data will support the future formulation of improved diets for Pacific salmon.

Feeding trials will be conducted at SEP hatcheries in Years 2 and 3 on juvenile ocean-type Chinook and Coho salmon. The diets to be compared will be selected based upon the results of Year 1 and agreed upon by the research team and SEP staff. Dr. Forster, the project lead, has extensive experience in conducting and peer-review publishing comparative feeding trials in salmon. Other team members have extensive experience in the assessment of physiological, immunological and health status of salmon.

Ultimately, this project will provide science-based advice to SEP facilities on the use of supplemented or specially formulated diets to better meet the needs of Pacific salmon and specifically address management concerns as to whether current industry-formulated feeds administered to juvenile ocean-type Chinook and Coho are sufficiently optimized.

2024-2025,2418,Prediction of reproductive success of Chinook salmon based on Thiamine concentrations in returning adults.,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,"Ian Forster, Cher LaCoste",Approved,"What is being proposed: Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency complex (TDC) is an emerging issue of concern for Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, in the North Pacific. Thiamine is an essential vitamin for all organisms, that is derived from their diet. Deficiency is most overtly expressed in salmonids as early mortality of fry, but secondary effects impact all life stages. TDC was first observed in the North Pacific in 2014 when up to 70% of Chinook from the Yukon River, a system which has experienced declines in Chinook productivity, were found to have limiting levels of egg thiamine (Larson and Howard 2019; Honeyfield et al. 2016). In 2020, TDC was diagnosed for the first time in California Chinook and found responsible for excessive fry mortality. Despite its presence both north and south of BC, to date, only a single study has measured thiamine levels in BC salmon and this included just two Chinook (Welch et al. 2018). TDC may already be an important driver of BC Chinook salmon population declines, and is expected to be an increasingly important issue as oceans warm and prey communities change. Significantly, when TDC is diagnosed there are effective treatment strategies to mitigate the effects which can be applied in hatcheries to limit fry mortality. Assessment and monitoring, of Thiamine deficiency can be used by SEP and StAD to inform planning decisions for stocks where expectations of reduced spawning performance may be expected, e.g., SEP could use this information to focus egg collection efforts, or remediation actions such as Thiamine injection / baths, on stocks that may be at greater risk of low spawning success. StAD could use this information to improve their assessment of the current status and health of salmon stocks.

2024-2025,2421,Measurement of stress hormones in scales and its application for the identification of conditions causing chronic stress in Pacific Salmon.,PSSI (B-base),Biotechnology and Genomics,Stewart Johnson,Submitted,"Exposure of fish to stressors can elicit physiological changes at multiple levels of animal organization, these alterations are collectively known as the stress response. The hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis which is activated in response to most forms of stress in fish, initiates and regulates the stress response. In fish cortisol is the predominant glucocorticoid released as part of the primary stress response, and is critical for mediating adaptive metabolic, physiological, and behavioral adjustments. However, prolonged elevation of cortisol, due to extended or repeated exposure to stressors, can negatively affect fish behavior, growth, reproduction and immune functions (reviewed in Schreck and Tort, 2016).

The analysis of circulating (serum/plasma) cortisol is the most common method used in stress response assessments in fish. This method works well under controlled situations, where fish can be caught and rapidly sampled (within minutes to avoid the rapid increase in cortisol which occurs in response to capture stress) and it provides information on the acute stress response at the time of collection (immediate state of stress). However, to understand chronic stress the past cortisol history of individuals needs to be understood. Fish scales have been recently recognized as a biomaterial that accumulates cortisol, and other physiologically important hormones including cortisone, over long periods of time. Moreover, scale cortisol levels are not affected by stress associated with capture (reviewed in Laberge et al. 2019; Kennedy and Janz, 2023).

Cortisol is released from the interrenals in fish as a biologically active steroid hormone. At the tissue level, the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11βhsd2) converts cortisol into its biologically inactive metabolite, cortisone. Importantly, this step is irreversible in fish, highlighting the importance of 11βhsd2 in the regulation of cortisol levels in teleosts (Tsachaki et al. 2017). Since 11βhsd2 is present in fish skin, assessing the expression of this enzyme in the skin during chronic stress, and measuring both cortisol and cortisone content will provide critical context for scale cortisol deposition and clearance, and further validate the use of scales as an indicator of chronic stress in fish.

We are proposing the use of levels of stress hormones (cortisol, cortisone) in scales as a tool for routine monitoring of chronic stress in different life history stages of Pacific salmon. As an example, this tool could be used to examine individual and population effects of external stressors encountered during migration on cortisol dynamics, which has implications with respect to population resilience to stressors such as climate change. The use of scales is minimally invasive and therefore suitable for use in populations of conservation concern. However, to interpret values obtained from scales we first need to understand the temporal profile of stress hormone accumulation and rates of clearance in scales under different environmental conditions for the different species of Pacific Salmon.

In this project we will conduct laboratory and hatchery-based studies to determine/optimize: 1) sampling methods (e.g. study spatial heterogeneity of scale stress hormone content (SSHC)), 2) effects of acute vs. chronic stress on SSHC, 3) relationship between plasma and SSHC, 4) individual, stock and temporal variability in SSHC, including changes associated with smoltification, and 5) effects of unpredictable chronic stress on plasma and SSHC. We will use, and modify, if necessary, analytical methods for SSHC that have been used in studies of goldfish and rainbow trout (Laberge et al. 2019; Kennedy and Janz, 2023).

2024-2025,2423,Complementing British Columbia’s coasts longest Sea Surface Temperature and Salinity records with 21st century technology to monitor a changing climate.,PSSI (B-base),Climate Change and Oceans,Jennifer Jackson,Approved,"At present, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data are collected as part of DFO’s British Columbia Shore Station Program (BCSOP) at twelve coastal stations that have been monitored for several decades, the earliest commencing in 1914 (see map below).

The data are collected manually, by lighthouses keepers, at a daily interval. Despite its success in providing data at remote locations for an outstanding duration (one of the longest in the world of this kind), the program faces challenges and limitations: gaps due to weather conditions, concerns with lighthouse keepers payment, time lag between data collection and reception and relatively coarse observational resolution. Theses challenges result in gaps in the timeseries which can limit their otherwise wide range of possible applications.

To address those challenges and enhance these valuable timeseries, we propose the testing and deployment of autonomous systems which can record SST and SSS at higher frequency (e.g. hourly) and transmit those data in near real-time. The system would consist of an in-situ sensors package, a data logger and transmitter and an antenna. Examples of such systems include elements of the Ocean Network Canada (https://data.oceannetworks.ca/home) and of Smart Atlantic, on the East coast (https://www.smartatlantic.ca/station_alt.html?id=dfo_nharb).

The main outcome of this project will be the acquisitions of continuous, gap-free, high resolution (hourly) timeseries of SST and SSS at key sites along the BC coast. These timeseries would be available in real-time mode and/or delay mode and posted online via the Open Data portal (https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/719955f2-bf8e-44f7-bc26-6bd623e82884) as well as on the Ocean Network Canada and Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS, https://cioos.ca/about/). The number of sites to be equipped upon successful testing (1st year) will depend on budget available (details below); a minimum of 4 stations would be necessary to be representative of the BC coast as a whole, i.e. Salish Sea (Chrome Island to Race Rocks), West coast (Amphitrite Point to Kains Island), North coast (Pine Island to Bonilla Island) and Haida Gwaii (Langara Island). Region and station priorities would be defined upon results of the first year tests and in coordination with other researchers and PSSI priorities.

SST and SSS characteristics determine the suitability of marine ecosystems habitat for native and invasive species that impacts migration patterns, predator-prey relationships and stock abundance. Data from the BCSOP currently contributes to fisheries management as input into forecasts of the northern diversion of Fraser River sockeye and models of salmon and anchovy stock abundance in the Strait of Georgia. Thus, enhanced data from this initiative would not only strengthen the current applications but also be helpful to newly implemented PSSI initiatives.

2024-2025,2424,Mechanistic modelling to link hydrology to juvenile salmon habitat quality and productivity,PSSI (B-base),Freshwater Habitat Research,Sean Naman,Approved,"Hydrology is a key determinant of salmon productivity and persistence in freshwater and is rapidly changing in many areas from human activities and climate warming. Yet, it remains challenging to make explicit predictions about how hydrology influences salmon. We aim to advance a mechanistic and tractable modelling framework that links hydrology (flow and temperature) to local-scale habitat availability and productivity potential of stream-rearing juvenile salmon. The proposed approach integrates well-established theory of geomorphology and fish energetics to predict how juvenile salmon rearing habitat availability and productivity potential is influenced by dynamic flow and temperature regimes (Fig. 1). The approach aims to be accessible by using a tractable set of inputs that would emerge from typical field habitat monitoring and is applicable across different systems and salmonid species. We propose rolling out this modelling framework as part of a larger watershed-scale research program in the North Thompson, where we have established an extensive field monitoring network of flow, temperature, and habitat conditions that would be direct model inputs. Ongoing intensive monitoring of juvenile coho populations and physiological condition (D. Patterson proposal) in these systems will inform model validation. For example, modelled predictions could be directly compared to measures of coho abundance, production, or physiological condition.

We anticipate 3 main outcomes from the work: (1) a modelling framework and interface (e.g., R Shiny App); (2) predictions of how juvenile coho rearing habitat availability and productivity potential responds to diverse flow and temperature regimes across tributaries of the North Thompson; and (3) advice to internal and external clients for setting environmental flow guidelines under dynamic hydrologic conditions. For example, the work will directly plug into ongoing engagement with the Thompson-Shuswap Environmental Flows Committee, which is actively developing flow management guidelines and drought response thresholds for the region. Further, the modelling framework will provide a platform to explore the potential consequences of climate and land use impacts on flows and temperatures, e.g., based on broader-scale, climate averaged temperature and flow projections under climate change (J. Iacarella proposal). This would provide a powerful, yet computationally simple and accessible way to explore and communicate the dynamic relationships between flows and salmon in a warming world. Overall, the approach is easily extendable to other systems and salmonid species, thus could become a widely used tool across the Province.

Approaches to predict biological responses to flow are integral to numerous management issues. We envision the modelling framework informing regulatory decision-making by FFHPP related to flow alterations (e.g., hydro operations or water withdrawals), as well as land use and restoration planning. Our work fills a gap for these applications given that existing instream flow modelling tends to either be static and descriptive and thus not applicable to dynamic conditions, or have prohibitively steep information and computational requirements. This is a 3-year project that would support two parallel elements: (1) collection of habitat, flow, and temperature data in coho rearing tributaries across the North Thompson; and (2) development of model structure and interface. Manuscript and report preparation and client engagement will occur primarily in years 2 and 3.

This project represents continued support for the Freshwater Spatial Ecology Program (Freshwater Ecosystems Section, ESD) which is providing three main outputs at a province wide scale that are critical for salmon management: geospatial layers to evaluate salmon habitat, salmon habitat suitability under current and future climate conditions, and cumulative effects on salmon freshwater habitat. Through these outputs, the program is working to address a very large gap in DFO’s understanding of where there is environmentally suitable and healthy habitat for salmon in freshwater, where there is at-risk habitat, and how this relates to salmon productivity at large spatial scales. This information is essential to meaningfully conduct any management prioritization related to the reliance of salmon populations on freshwater habitats, but is challenging to obtain given the extensive spatial scale of the Pacific Region and limited data.

Expected outcomes for Year 1: (1) Modelled and mapped August mean stream temperatures for 20-year time intervals across climate change scenarios; (2) Collation of remote sensing data for BC and beginning analysis to identify riparian and off channel habitat for salmon; (3) Maps of experimentally-derived thermally tolerable and intolerable streams under climate change conditions across BC linked to known locations of juvenile habitat use; (4) Completion of thermal growth experiments from egg to fry for two populations of coho under naturally variable stream conditions and +2/+4 °C temperature treatments; (5) Modelled and mapped cumulative effect scores for salmon spawning habitat across the Fraser basin (to be extended province wide provided ongoing funding), and assessment of change in cumulative effects seasonally and over time delivered as a CSAS Research Document for FFHPP Integrated Planning; (6) Modelled and mapped environmentally suitable streams (and uncertainty estimation) under current and future climate conditions for all 5 Pacific salmon species across BC; and (7) Spatial analysis of modelled, climate averaged flow and stream temperature based threats on salmon ecosystems under climate change in the Thompson-Nicola region delivered as a CSAS Science Response for FFHPP Integrated Planning for Salmon Ecosystems.

2024-2025,2426,Sakinaw Sockeye Juvenile Research on Measures to Increase Marine Survival,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,"Kevin Pellett, Nicolette Watson, Karalea Filipovic",Approved,"Sakinaw sockeye smolts out-migrate from Sakinaw Lake each spring into the Strait of Georgia. Recovery efforts have determined that the marine survival of this population is very low, which is a major limiting factor to population recovery. On water surveys of pinnipeds from the estuary out to the seal haul outs on Hodgson Islands (approximately 2km from the estuary, Figure 1) during the spring out-migration timing (since 2019) have estimated from approximately 100-350 harbour seals in the area.

This project was started as a pilot in 2022 to test the hypothesis that the Hodgson Island harbour seal population is negatively affecting smolt survival, and subsequently adult returns. The goal of the project is to transport and release smolts past the seal haul out and then compare marine survival rates between transported smolts and those out-migrating naturally. The pilot project began with a low number of smolts transported in small trial releases to test the effect of additional handling/ osmoregulation on fish as well as the function of equipment. Small numbers of fish were PIT tagged to confirm fish are able to recover from the procedure and be transported on the same day. Additional activities included continuation of harbour seal counts (Figure 2) on local haul outs during the smolt (May) and adult (July) peak migration windows. Transport activities are conducted with shíshálh Nation’s newly acquired 30 foot aluminum landing craft which is suited to this kind of work.

In years 2-5 (spring 2023-2026), we propose scaling up releases to achieve adequate sample sizes in order to properly test the hypothesis. A minimum of 1,000 and up to 2,500 PIT tagged sockeye are recommended per year such that a 1% survival will yield a total of 10-25 tag returns. Return rates of less than 1% may be too low to justify operationalizing this activity long term. The transport of non-tagged fish should be avoided as to not confound comparisons with the control group (untagged fence migrants). Results from 2023/24 releases will be realized in 2025/26 escapement years at which point a decision on the future of the project can be made. Additional activities may include walking the Hodson Island haul out with a mobile PIT tag antenna to look for evidence of predation on out migrating smolts (river or transport groups; Coho and Sockeye), or installing a PIT antenna on the haul out.

Sakinaw Sockeye has been confirmed as an endangered stock since 2003, and a recovery potential assessment, completed in 2017 cited low marine survival as the greatest limiting factor in recovery, with predator abundance and assumed predation on smolts and adults ranked as high risk, with a critical level of impact. Perpetually low marine survivals are preventing recovery such that the persistence of the population is entirely dependent on a captive brood program. This activity may be one of the few tools available to increase survival.

This analysis was used to develop a predictive model of survival. The current sampling frequency is monthly. Increased frequency, particularly in the spring and fall will allow better resolution of physical processes and on match-mismatch between juvenile salmon and they prey in the Strait. Further, increased sampling frequency will improve resolution of physical measurements which benefit both statistical power and model prediction. The project expands upon the current monthly SoG plankton survey program (22 stations) to include additional biweekly surveys starting mid-February through to mid-April and then again late August through end of September. These additional surveys would target a key subset of stations with: 1) sampling focused on the plankton component of juvenile salmon diets (krill, amphipods, and decapod larvae); 2) biochemical measurements of zooplankton production rates and photochemical measurements of phytoplankton production rates; and 3) ancillary measurements required for estimates of food web energy transfer efficiency. The primary objective is to measure the quantity, quality, and production rate of a key dietary component as well as the entire zooplankton community. Variation of zooplankton production rates are more sensitive than biomass to environmental variation occurring on timescales relevant to juvenile salmon foraging. Community-level productivity estimates will be used to measure ecological efficiency; the amount of energy available to consumers of zooplankton.

2024-2025,2430,Feasibility of Estimating Chilko River Smolt Abundance Using Upward- and Side-Looking SONAR Methods,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Daniel Doutaz,Approved,"Chilko Sockeye salmon represent the only wild Sockeye indicator stock in the Fraser watershed. The annual Chilko Lake Sockeye smolt assessment (1951-present) comprises the only long-term time series data available to assess juvenile recruitment, and freshwater and marine productivity for wild Fraser River Sockeye salmon. Since program inception, Sockeye smolts have been enumerated during their out-migration from Chilko Lake using a traditional fish counting weir and photographic sampling/counting techniques. During the first six decades of the program (1951-2012), interruptions in weir operation were relatively rare: in only three years (1979, 1993, 2006) did early freshets necessitate removal of the weir before the vast majority of smolts had migrated from Chilko Lake.

Recently, unusually early freshets have been experienced in the Chilko watershed that have translated into high and variable water conditions much earlier in the season. As such, DFO Stock Assessment crews were not able to operate the weir in 2015 due to high water flows, and have had to remove the weir structure prior to the completion of smolt migration on numerous other recent years (e.g., 2019). The observed increase in the frequency of early freshets in the Chilko watershed is consistent with predicted hydrographic changes for interior BC streams as a whole in response to climate variability, with the average timing of the spring freshet expected to continue shifting earlier as air temperatures rise. The future of operating the Chilko Sockeye smolt weir is in jeopardy given the current trend related to the timing, frequency, and strength of the spring freshets. If proven effective, the SONAR method would provide an alternate assessment method for the Chilko watershed that could be quickly employed in years when high flows either prevent the installation of the weir at the beginning of the migration, or necessitate the removal of the weir before the smolt migration is largely complete.

The objective of this work is to test the feasibility of using upward-looking SONAR technology to assess daily abundances of Chilko Lake sockeye smolts as they migrate downstream through the Chilko River. This technology has proven to be effective for enumerating migrating smolts in comparable rivers in Alaska. The reliably of the method will be evaluated based on how well the daily SONAR-derived abundance indices predict the daily migration totals observed at the counting weir that is deployed annually on the Chilko River. A pilot study employing this technology was initiated within the Chilko watershed in the spring of 2021, and following two consecutive years of data collection the results appear to be promising; however, in both 2021 and 2022, water levels have been below seasonal averages and we have yet to experience a high-water event with the SONARs in place. Additional years of this project are therefore required before any conclusions can be made regarding the effectiveness of this technology as a substitute for the currently employed counting weir on the Chilko River.

The specific case study that we will use as a proof of concept for this technology is the GREB1L gene in Puntledge River Chinook Salmon. GREB1L is a gene that explains a large amount of the variation in run timing for Chinook Salmon. Specific SNPs in the GREB1L gene are currently used as diagnostic genetic markers to retroactively distinguish between summer and fall runs of Chinook in the Puntledge River Hatchery. These markers have two alleles one of which is primarily carried by early returning Chinook Salmon and the other by late returning salmon. Current management of enhancement at the Puntledge River Hatchery uses a date threshold to ensure most ""summer run"" fish carry the early-run allele to preserve the genetic integrity of this population segment. Rapid in-season genotyping results would allow more accurate and expanded use of available broodstock for the Puntledge summer run. SHERLOCK assays are field deployable genotyping assays that can generate a result in under an hour and may provide this capacity to enhancement efforts in the Puntledge River. The technology has previously been demonstrated for rapid genotyping purposes including GREB1L markers in California populations of Chinook Salmon.

In the initial phases of the project, the focus will begin on the southern coastal populations. While stock delineation using the existing SNP panel is close to Conservation Unit-level resolution, there remain difficult delineations to make that are of interest to stock assessment and management. For year 1, the focus will be predominately on the lower Fraser, where delineation of Chilliwack River from the remaining lower Fraser populations remains difficult in the current analysis methods but is desired to support management objectives. To better understand what differentiates these populations, we will use next generation sequencing technologies to perform low-coverage whole genome sequencing on a selection of spawning populations in the lower Fraser, Chilliwack River, and select populations in the Salish sea in the first year - this will include enhanced stocks from each region. Future analyses will identify where differences stocks exist and allow for the selection of genetic markers to better delineate among them, thereby allowing for more accurate assessment and enhancement methods using genetic techniques.

This initial effort will be built upon in future years by extending sampling to additional regions where further stock delineation is necessitated to meet assessment and enhancement objectives, such as Strait of Georgia/Howe Sound, West Coast Vancouver Island, and Johnstone Strait and the Central Coast.

2024-2025,2437,Adaptive genetic variation and climate change resilience in Canadian Pacific salmon,PSSI (B-base),Biotechnology and Genomics,"Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband",Approved,"Pacific salmon are broadly distributed across western Canada and the northern Pacific Ocean with spawning grounds located over a wide diversity of freshwater habitats. In general, Pacific salmon return to their natal spawning grounds to reproduce, and not surprisingly this has resulted in substantial genetic variation among different salmon populations throughout the Canadian range. Genetic variants among and within populations of the majority of Canadian Pacific salmon have been characterized using relatively low numbers of genetic markers, and this characterization has enabled the development of the genetic-stock identification and parentage-based tagging programs within Fisheries and Oceans Canada which provide vital information for management of fisheries and hatcheries. Despite the utility of these developments, low-density genetic markers are insufficient to assess adaptive genetic variation in these species, leaving critical gaps for conserving fitness-associated genetic diversity and for improving resilience to climate change. Previously, the costs of next-generation sequencing were prohibitive for assessing genome-wide genetic variation in species with large genomes such as salmonids. However, reductions in these costs combined with publication of reference genome sequences for the Pacific salmonids has opened novel opportunities to address these gaps. The proposed project will utilize low-coverage whole-genome resequencing to assess genome-wide patterns of genetic variation among and within populations of Pacific salmon. These data will feed into several analyses to identify genomic regions and variation involved in environmental adaptation, to reassess the genetic support for currently defined conservation unit boundaries, and to estimate the relative climate change resilience of different populations of Canadian Pacific salmon. Initially, the proposed project will focus on Chinook and Sockeye Salmon with a goal of sequencing individuals from 48 populations of each species distributed across the species’ range. We will leverage samples currently available in the Molecular Genetics DNA archives to enable these efforts. In the longer-term, the objectives of this project will expand these sequencing efforts to increase the coverage of individuals, populations and species of Pacific salmon. This expansion of scope will be necessary to fully consider conservation of within population genetic diversity, and to resolve parallel patterns of genetic adaptation across Pacific salmon in Canada. The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Identify 48 populations representative of the range-wide diversity of Chinook and Sockeye Salmon. 2) Obtain samples from 18 Chinook individuals or 8 Sockeye individuals from each identified population from the Molecular Genetics DNA archives, and extract DNA for each sample. 3) Prepare the extracted DNA samples for low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, and submit the samples to an external sequencing service provider. 4) Collect relevant environmental datasets and climate change projections for the locations and life histories of the identified populations. 5) Receive sequencing reads for all submitted DNA samples. The long-term objectives of the study are: 6) Align sequencing reads from the first year of the study to the Chinook or Sockeye Salmon reference genomes. 7) Determine allele frequency variation among and within populations of each species. 8) Analyze genome-wide population structure in each species and identify outlier regions of genetic differentiation among populations. 9) Analyze genome-environment associations to resolve environmental factors underlying genetic differentiation among populations. 10) Utilize current inter-population genomic variation to determine “genomic offsets” in the context of climate change projections (i.e., the extent of genetic change necessary to parallel expected changes in the environment). 11) Expand sampling and sequencing effort to include Chum, Pink and Coho Salmon, and to add additional Chinook and Sockeye Salmon population that address any gaps in the initial analysis. 12) Repeat the analyses above across species to evaluate cross-species patterns and factors important to Pacific salmon adaptation in Canada. 13) Report on genome-wide genetic variation in comparison to existing conservation unit boundaries with dedicated consideration of putatively adaptive genetic variation. 14) Report on genetic estimates of relative climate change resilience among different populations of each Pacific salmon species examined.

2024-2025,2439,Modernizing Fish Age Estimation using Fourier Transform-Near Infrared and Neural Network Techniques,PSSI (B-base),Biotechnology and Genomics,Stephen Wischniowski,Approved,"The Sclerochronology Lab (SCL) provides a unique central service for Pacific Regional DFO clientele involved in the management of commercially important species of salmon, herring, groundfish and shellfish by providing users with consistent high quality age estimates, monitoring growth patterns influenced by environmental pressures, and providing products and services developed through strategic, innovative and collaborative research programs. Age information is a key piece of data used by biologists to assess the health of marine fin/shellfish populations (Ricker 1975; Hilborn and Walters 1992; Campana and Thorrold 2001). Age structured stock assessments facilitate judicious fisheries resource management decisions commonly via CSAS processes which depend on high quality and consistent age-data. Commercial Fisheries programs are managed in partnership with stakeholders relying on scientific assessments and are dependent on consultative processes to develop and review policies, procedures and regulations.

SCL intellectual knowledge achieved through the experience of long-term observations (40+yrs) (Campana, 1992; Hesler et al., 2019) is safeguarded not only in documentation, but more so as a living document in the staff's collective ability to recognize and identify growth patterns. To maintain this continuous and uninterrupted level of service the SCL relies on a comprehensive training regime designed specifically to withstand sporadic events of attrition including the loss of knowledge by way of retirements. Managing staff changes in the SCL, particularly retirements post 2020 has seen an unprecedented number of senior staff retire, fundamentally challenging the SCL’s ability to maintain the forementioned scope of training and intellectual knowledge. The SCL, and other Committee of Fish Ageing Experts (CARE) agencies are recognizing that the reliance on traditional ways of fish age estimation may not be sustainable as demands only seem to increase while the ability to retain knowledgeable staff diminishes.

The SCL has initiated investigations into alternative means of estimating fish age. Fourier Transform-Near Infrared (FT-NIR) Spectroscopy and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently gained attention in the ability to reproduce accurate age assignments when calibrated against known age, or the best age that can be provided, to produced results complimentary to the traditional means of estimation fish age. Both techniques require continuous “training” or “maintenance” to ensure that all variations of patterned growth both spatial and temporarily are experienced by the algorithm. Once sufficient volume has been attained the output capacity and time required to produce age assignments is substantially faster than what can be attained by traditional ageing.

Fourier Transform-Near Infrared. FT-NIR spectroscopy has recently been applied to rapidly predict fish age, gaining attention among fisheries managers as a potential alternative to timely and costly production ageing of managed species (Passerotti et al., 2020). Age prediction capability of FT-NIRS has been tested on the otoliths of chinook salmon (Claiborne et al., 2019), walleye pollock (Hesler et al., 2019), red snapper (Passerotti et al., 2020), barramundi (Wright et al., 2021), Pacific cod (Healy et al., 2021), longnose skate (Arrington et al., 2021) as well as the vertebrae of two shark species (Rigby et al. 2014, 2016), with potentially promising results. Studies on eastern Bering Sea walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) have shown that ages derived from FT-NIRS are not only precise but may demonstrate less bias than traditional ageing methods (Helser et al., 2018). Studies conducted by collaborators at NOAA have indicated that FT-NIRS has the capacity to increase age outputs of walleye pollock from 35 ages per day to 360 ages per day (Hesler et al., 2019). If successful, new applications of FT-NIRS technology will provide a promising approach to consolidate research tools, operationalize timely data collection methods for age determination directly benefiting fisheries researchers and managers, as well as other research projects led by StAR, SEP, and Indigenous communities.

Convolutional Neural Networks. Significant progress in use of automated pattern recognition based on machine learning has been achieved in recent years. The availability of deep learning packages for open-source software has provided the opportunity to analyze large volumes of unstructured data (e.g., images, video, audio, etc.) quickly and efficiently (Polacek et al. 2022). These advancements in deep learning have proven effective at solving a range of complex problems related to unstructured data in many disciplines, including the age assignments of otoliths and scales of teleost’s (Cayetano et al. 2024, Moen et al. 2018 and Vabo et al. 2021). The SCL is working in collaboration with the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSFRC) in the development of a computer vision (CHUMputer Vision) pipeline to predict the age assignments of Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) by way of digitized scale images. Both the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) and the Pacific Biological Station will provide selected pre-aged scale images of Chum (age range 0 to 7 yrs.) to train the Python data pipeline code. To ensure model robustness sufficient samples of all age ranges must be configured. Currently, sufficient age classes of 03 and 04 (European age classification) are contained. The Sclerochronology Lab will sources shoulder year age classes, assist in imaging, preprocess enhancement and model testing. Chum have been selected for their ease of interpretation of the non-freshwater pattern. Ultimately however, the goal is to reach algorithm sophistication to interpret the complexities of freshwater growth patterns, to which age assignments can be estimated for Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha).

2024-2025,2442,Graduate Research into 1) habitat use by juvenile Chinook Salmon in the Canadian Okanagan River and Lake system and 2) predation on juvenile salmon in the Canadian Okanagan River and Lake system,PSSI (B-base),Freshwater Habitat Research,"Lauren Weir, Tommy Pontbriand",Approved,"Okanagan Chinook are the only remaining Columbia River Chinook Salmon population in Canada. Their abundance is very low, currently less than a couple hundred spawners, but their abundance was likely in the high thousands before the Canadian Okanagan and Columbia River were developed for Agriculture, Flood Control, and Hydro-power Generation, resulting in physical exclusion from spawning and rearing habitats. Fishing rates have also been high through history, with recent (2009-2018) exploitation rates around 60%. The population in the U.S. section of the Okanagan River has recently ranged from 7,000-14,000 spawners.

COSEWIC has identified this single river Designatable Unit as ENGANGERED, and it is currently undergoing review for listing under the Species at Risk Act. Additionally, this stock is part of Batch 1 for the Fish Stock Provisions under the Fisheries Act. The DFO has considerable engagement with First Nations, the Okanagan Water Management Board, the Okanagan River Restoration Initiative, as well as the Colville Confederated Tribes, the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Pacific Salmon Commission. Rebuilding the abundance of Okanagan Chinook is a priority for First Nations and local, provincial, and national fisheries agencies on both sides of the boarder.

Recently, the Pacific Salmon Commission conducted a series of 5 workshops with fisheries professionals and First Nations which examined threats, impediments to survival, and mitigation approaches to increase the abundance of Okanagan Chinook. Similarly, a Recovery Potential Assessment (DFO Pacific Region CSAS) and DFO Risk Assessment Methods (RAMS) have been applied and also identified threats and mitigations. Among the issues identified in these assessments, the key ones include Climate Change and its influence on the thermal and hydrological regime of the Okanagan, channelization and the disconnection of the main river channels from the historic and off-channel stream habitats, and predation by invasive fish species. Two of the data gaps that were highlighted from this work are the juvenile habitat use in the Okanagan, which has been highly disturbed and degraded, and the level of predation on juvenile Chinook salmon by native and non-native fishes. To enable rebuilding it will be essential to have information on habitat use and to understand the threat posed by predation. Graduate students provide the most efficient way to answer these critical research questions. The use of graduate students will allow for targeted and timely research while building capacity and knowledge for when they enter the workforce.

2024-2025,2443,Quantitative assessment of the impact of Smallmouth Bass suppression efforts in Cultus Lake and SMB emigration from Cultus Lake,PSSI (B-base),Freshwater Habitat Research,Daniel Doutaz,Approved,"Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), a piscivorous fish species native to eastern North America, have been introduced into Cultus Lake, British Columbia. Cultus Lake is home to endangered sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) as well as endemic Cultus pygmy sculpin (Cottus aleuticus). Smallmouth bass introduced in other salmon-bearing habitat have been observed to exert substantial mortality on salmon fry and smolts, suggesting a similar impact may be possible in Cultus Lake. Observations of sockeye salmon, and Cultus pygmy sculpin in the diet of captured smallmouth bass demonstrates predation upon two native species at risk. While smallmouth bass represent a threat to the Cultus Lake native fish community and species at risk specifically, they are also highly valued by some anglers. Importantly, as a source population, they also represent a real and present threat to other ecosystems in the Lower Mainland. Smallmouth bass are often found in streams and rivers; in fact, they have already been found downstream of Cultus Lake. Additionally, there is the threat of anglers moving smallmouth bass to other waterbodies in the Lower Mainland to create new bass fisheries, which themselves would create risk to receiving environments. While there are largemouth bass (M. salmoides) populations in various waterbodies throughout the Lower Mainland, this is the first verified smallmouth bass population, and has drawn a lot of attention from the angling community. Early work on this population has identified a divergence of public opinions: some value native species (especially sockeye salmon) and want to see bass suppressed; other values angling opportunities for smallmouth bass and will strongly oppose any measures to affect this valued fishery resource.

There are two issues that this project will address: (1) understanding which suppression options will result in the lowest opposition from anglers and community members, thereby identifying the risk of unintended consequences (e.g., additional transfers to other lakes); and (2) determining the suppression strategy (combination of different suppression options) which will best inform estimates of effectiveness for each suppression option so as to maximize effective suppression moving forward to reduce impacts on sockeye salmon recruitment.

In year one of this project, an electrofishing boat will be used to capture smallmouth bass, and all bass will be tagged with passive integrated transponders (PIT tags). These PIT-tagged fish will help determine the initial population size (through mark-recapture methods) and provide a baseline for future smallmouth bass suppression efforts. A subset of smallmouth bass will also be tagged using acoustic transmitters (n=25; Vemco V9 & V13 acoustic tags) to track their movements within the Cultus Lake system, and to determine if any emigration out of the system is occurring.

The smallmouth bass fishery will be monitored to assess total fishing effort (using standard access point creel survey procedures), harvest rates, harvest size, and catch rates (total number fish released + harvested). All harvested bass reported by anglers will be measured, weighted, scanned for PIT tags, and have scales removed for later aging. Additionally, as part of the catch monitoring program anglers will be surveyed to determine their level of satisfaction with their bass catch rates and size, native fish catch rates and their opinions on the different suppression options considered. These survey answers will allow for changes in utility and attitudes to be tracked over time.

Lastly, nest destruction and removal of male bass guarding nests is to occur once spawning begins in the spring. Bass activity in the spring should be monitored frequently to identify the start of spawning season. Once nests are constructed, a survey of known spawning locations should occur to identify nests for destruction. Captured males will be measured, weighed, have sex and maturity status confirmed, scanned for PIT tags, and have scales and/or otoliths removed for aging.

This project was developed in partnership between Simon Fraser University, the Province of BC, and the DFO. Please see the attached ""Cultus Lake Smallmouth Bass Suppression Plan.pdf"" in the ""Supporting Resources"" section for additional information on subsequent years of this project.

2024-2025,2444,Assessment of the distribution and abundance of juvenile Chinook salmon in the lower Thompson River basin.,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Colin Bailey,Approved,"The overall objective of the project is to obtain annual estimates of fall (October) standing stock for chinook fry in principal spawning tributaries and the mainstem of the lower Thompson River, and to describe, quantitatively, the uncertainty associated with these estimates. The work will be completed by an independent contractor who conducted similar studies previously (200-2012) and is familiar with the area and study design.

The field work will consist of calibrated night snorkeling surveys (Hagen et al. 2010) in the Lower Thompson River System including all major spawning tributaries (Nicola, Coldwater, Spius, Deadman, Criss, Bonaparte, and Thompson River mainstem) and subsequent data analysis and reporting over the winter months. It will draw closely on the previous steelhead and Chinook juvenile assessments completed by the contractor in the lower Thompson River system for both the design of field and analysis methods. Results from this work will contribute to the time series of juvenile abundance gathered over 10 years from 2001 to 2012 and the subsequent analysis.

This information will contribute to an assessment of ongoing impacts of the historic 2021 flood on Nicola 42 Chinook egg-to-fry survival and recruitment and will lead to a better understanding of the impacts of catastrophic flooding on salmonids generally and provide specific insights into Nicola recruitment and juvenile use of the post flood system. This information may provide insights into management decisions as well as on prioritizing watershed restoration activities. Additionally, this project could build on the previous fry assessment work to provide useful information about stock productivity and carrying capacity, and aid in developing escapement goals and recovery planning.

2024-2025,2447,Innovative Ecosystem Based Approaches to identify cumulative stressors: Salmon Fit-Chips and eDNA,PSSI (B-base),Biotechnology and Genomics,Kristi Saunders,Approved,"Climate change has negatively impacted productivity of many Canadian Pacific salmon stocks and species, but the cumulative interplay between environmental stress and changes to salmon ecosystems impacting survival are still yet to be fully evaluated. This knowledge is required to identify effective mediation strategies under anthropogenic control. An innovative salmon Fit-Chip tool is poised to fill this knowledge gap. The salmon Fit-Chip tool contains curated biomarker panels that can specifically recognize independent stressors (thermal, osmotic, hypoxia), disease states (viral), imminent mortality (natural death within 72 hours), and smolt readiness (differentiating pre-smolts, smolts and de-smolts), based on profiling from non-lethal gill biopsy samples. Fit-chips also contain biomarkers associated with inflammation and immune activation, and can include assays to key pathogens and parasites.

While physical oceanographic monitoring can provide environmental measures of temperature, oxygen, and salinity, they do not tell us whether fish are actually experiencing stress, or possibly avoiding areas where these stressors occur. Fit-Chip data allow us to directly test whether the highest ranking environmental risk factors identified in the WCVI Marine Risk Assessments—elevated temperature summer through early fall and reduced oxygen in the fall, the moderate risk of carryover effects (in this case smolt readiness rather than size) and exposure to HABs, cause physiological stress and impairment in Chinook salmon. Moreover, Fit-Chips can effectively identify habitats where salmon are least vs most compromised, allowing regulators and habitat biologists to target remediation where needed most, with remediation success tracked via decreased stress.

Working within the West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) ""Follow the fish"" Research Consortium funded under PSSI, under objective 1, we will run Fit-Chips on 2,000 Chinook released from Robertson and Nitinat hatcheries sampled over the migration trajectory from freshwater-estuary-marine, including overwintering Chinook caught across all 5 WCVI sounds through microtrolling led by local First Nations. Using a south coast wide Fit-Chip dataset developed in 2022-2023 using PSSI funding, comprised of over 4500 Chinook sampled from 2008-2018, we will employ stock-recruitment models to identify associations between individual stressors and population-level survival across the southern BC coast, and build a new model framework to address the cumulative interplay between stress and disease undermining survival. This analysis will address several of the risk factors identified in the WCVI Marine Risk Assessment for Chinook salmon, including climate-driven environmental stressors (temperature, hypoxia, salinity) and pathogens/disease, and their association with survival. We will then apply this knowledge to our Fit-Chip data on WCVI Chinook collected from 2022-2024, along with the physical oceanographic data collected at the same time, to identify where and when environmental stressors are “felt” by WCVI Chinook, including their relationship with measured environmental parameters, and where and when signs of increased morbidity occur. Importantly, this spatial analysis will also address the anthropogenically controlled intrinsic and extrinsic factors associated with stressors and diseases that pose the highest population-level risk to WCVI Chinook. The ultimate goal is to identify stressor and/or disease impacts that can be effectively mediated to increase early marine survival of salmon, and habitats where mediation is most urgently required.

The WCVI Marine Risk Assessments identified prey availability/feeding a high current and future risk, pathogens/parasites a moderate current and high future risk, and predation/HABs a moderate risks. Data gaps were identified for all of these risk factors. While multiple individual projects are proposed to tackle most of these risk factors and where they are most strongly felt in Barclay and Clayoquot Sound, eDNA offers a more holistic tool to identify the species compositions – e.g. salmon spp, predators, prey, competitors, infective agents, HABs, that can corroborate community assessment more efficiently over a broader spatial scale. Under objective 2, we will carry out eDNA sampling in the same areas and seasons where the follow the fish project is actively catching fish, starting in the estuaries and Barclay Sound in spring/summer, and moving into Clayoquot sound in the early fall and throughout all five sounds overwinter. In addition to providing an ecosystem characterization via metabarcoding, and pathogens through our infective agent monitoring system -- including potential hot-spot areas around farms/processing plants, eDNA may also provide more information on areas of the sound where salmon are more or less abundant. Importantly, under this objective we will integrate data analyses with projects using a more traditional species assessments (e.g. via plankton sampling, HAB monitoring, hydroacoustics). Importantly, when contrasting eDNA community compositions in ecosystems where salmon show indices of optimal vs compromised health, we can provide a second pillar to develop and measure the effectiveness of mediation efforts.

Cumulative effects modeling will be carried over from the first year to assess the cumulative and synergistic interplay between high ranking pathogens and stressors (individually associated with population-level effects) to build a better understanding of factors that may be more than simply additive that if targeted for mediation, could dramatically improve survival.  As we can only control factors that are under human influence, knowledge of synergistic relationships between stressors will provide resource managers targets for remediation and if not mitigated, could be incorporated into models predicting return numbers.  Cumulative impacts modeling is anticipated to continue through the 2023-2024 fiscal year, with considerable expansion provided by the inclusion of a full-time BI03 analyst (Art Bass) in this second year.  It is anticipated that during the second year, the analyst will develop cumulative factors models based both on the 10-year long southern BC coast Chinook dataset analysed for single factor influences on survival in the first year, and on all years of overwinter microtroll collections (3) and both years of FtF collections in Barclay Sound.   Working closely with our database manager, Carl Llewellyn, and RES02 eDNA expert (Christoph Deeg), as well as leads of the other FtF projects to begin to develop a format for cumulative effects monitoring in the third year of PSSI that will merge all relevant data collected on factors that may contribute to poor marine survival of WCVI Chinook salmon.  It is expected that in the third year of PSSI, stock assessment will provide an additional modeler to work collaboratively with Bass, Llewellyn, Deeg, and possibly others to build the most comprehensive, data-driven modeling to address the cumulative and synergistic interplay between key factors undermining salmon condition and survival identified in the WCVI Chinook Marine Risk Assessments, including prey availability, environmental stress (climate and anthropogenic), pathogens, toxicants/harmful algae, predators, competition, and freshwater carryover effects.  Understanding of the cumulative interplay between stressors, stressors and disease, and interactions with prey availability/predation, will provide an ability to predict the impacts of reducing one, but not all stressors associated with survival.  
2. Using the WCVI data, we will apply hot-spot analyses to localize regions of the coast where salmon are most compromised by stress/disease, to inform habitats most in need of remediation measures.  Models that additionally explore associations with anthropogenic-influenced factors, like industrialization activities, logging, agriculture/aquaculture, etc.. may also be used to help managers develop regulatory changes that will lead to decreased impacts on wild salmon.

2024-2025,2448,"Developing a proactive, modernized, holistic approach to ensure optimal health and condition of Hatchery Production",PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,"Kristi Saunders, Karia Kaukinen, Arthur Bass",Approved,"In years 1 and 2, a proactive holistic health monitoring approach based on high throughput molecular technologies was validated for utility in two salmon enhancement hatcheries, and is now ready in year 3 for minimally invasive application in hatcheries culturing conservation stocks, the objective from the start of the program. The technical approach revealed annual shifts in stress, infection, and timing of smolt readiness identified through salmon Fit-Chips, and eDNA analyses found the source water to be a major determinate of infections in hatchery cohorts. As such, future monitoring of pathogens in hatchery source water will be crucial to minimize infection potential and maximize post-release survival in stocks of conservation concern. Moreover, monitoring of water from natal watersheds where conservation stocks will be released is also critical to understand whether hatchery production may risk the introduction of pathogens not detected in those watersheds, and to guide mitigation measures, if necessary.

Overview of past and future approach:

Two modern molecular-based approaches have been successfully applied to assess shifts in holistic health of hatchery cohorts: 1) Salmon Fit-Chips applied to gill biopsy samples to assess stress, infection, disease, and smolt readiness, and 2) environmental RNA (eRNA) applied to source water coming into the hatchery and culture tanks/ponds to monitor presence and abundance of dozens of pathogens and parasites. After two years of validation at two enhancement hatcheries, these technologies are deployment ready for non-lethal application in hatcheries culturing stocks of conservation concern.

In 2022-2024, enhancement stock cohorts at Nitinat and Robertson Creek hatcheries were sampled bi-weekly/monthly over two years of production. A database to capture meta and molecular data, and scripts for semi-automated reporting were developed. Fit-Chip data revealed shifting levels of thermal and oxygen stress across hatchery cohorts in the first year, and no apparent stress in the second year. Viral disease associated with PSnV infection in gill tissue was associated with hypoxia stress and morbidity at one hatchery. Altering source water resulted in a shift in pathogen profiles in fish across hatcheries. In 2023, only 50% of Chinook reached full smolt status at the time of release, whereas over 90% of fish were full smolts at release in 2024 across both hatcheries.

In 2025-2026, a minimally invasive approach will be applied to up to 8 Conservation Hatchery Stocks cultured across 4-6 hatcheries, with SEP management making the final determinations of stocks that will benefit most from proactive health monitoring. Gill biopsies from all moribund fish and bi-weekly collection of water filters for eRNA will be collected by hatchery staff, with preserved samples mailed bi-weekly to PBS. water will be sampled both from tanks and source water into the hatcheries, as well, when possible, the water where conservation stocks will be released. This is critical to understand if there are pathogens that these stocks may pick up in the hatchery that are not detected in their natural environments. Hatchery staff will be provided training and sampling kits by January 2025. Molecular analyses of gill and water samples would be processed simultaneously for all participating hatcheries upon receipt, and bi-weekly reports sent back to hatcheries. Hatchery managers can use this information to address husbandry needs that minimize infection/stress and guide release timing to optimize post-release survival.

Importantly, the AHA tool is implemented deterministically and does not account for uncertainty in population dynamics or associated risk to management and therefore does not conform to DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework. The proposed tool will fill a critical gap in DFO’s ability to strategically evaluate decisions on all three management levers, and can act as flagship for the implementation of a Management Procedure Framework1 in the future.

Objectives of hatchery enhancement span conserving at-risk stocks, rebuilding lower abundance stocks, providing harvest opportunities and increasing public awareness through outreach and education. However, there are also risks associated with hatchery enhancement; differences between a hatchery and a natural habitat affect both the genetic and environmental factors that shape the performance and fitness of salmon. Consequently, hatchery-origin salmon may be less suited to wild habitats than their natural-origin counterparts, and the presence of hatchery-origin fish on a natural spawning ground may reduce the fitness of a population overall. The relative fitness of hatchery-origin compared to natural-origin salmon has been estimated in a handful of systems through determination of relative reproductive success (RRS). In these studies, returning adults are assigned back to their parents using genetic tags called parentage-based tags, and RRS is inferred by the number of returns per family from hatchery-origin compared to natural-origin parents. In general, the results of RRS studies suggest that hatchery-origin fish have lower natural reproductive success than natural-origin fish, and this reduced RRS is potentially transferred across generations. Despite this pattern, the extent to which hatchery-origin fitness is lower than natural-origin fitness is likely dependent on current and historical factors impacting specific systems, including hatchery practices. To date, no study has estimated the RRS of hatchery- and natural-origin Pacific salmonids in integrated populations enhanced by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). This is a critical knowledge gap for effectively managing hatchery production, as genetic management of these systems currently assumes a RRS of 0.8. This value is a reasonable consensus value from published estimates in USA rivers, but the SEP has had clear guidelines for genetic management since at least the 1980s, and it is possible that RRS estimates from USA hatcheries are inaccurate for SEP hatcheries. Utilization of an inaccurate RRS estimate could result in mismanagement of genetic risks associated with hatchery production, because the number of hatchery-origin fish that are predicted to utilize the natural spawning grounds increases as RRS increases, whereas a high RRS infers relatively low negative consequences for fitness associated with hatchery-origin spawners. Therefore, accurate estimation of RRS is important for effective genetic management of SEP hatcheries, particularly in the context of managing the influences of the hatchery and natural environments on the adaptive trajectories of integrated populations (i.e., proportionate natural influence or “PNI”). The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Initiate extensive genetic sampling of both the escapement and broodstock for at least one Pacific salmon population enhanced by the SEP (confirmed population: Sarita River Chinook Salmon). 2) Use a genetic biomarker panel to genotype these natural-origin and hatchery-origin parents. 3) Explore alternative approaches to enable widespread RRS estimation across SEP hatcheries even in systems where extensively escapement sampling is infeasible. The long-term objectives of the study are: 4) Explore options to increase sampling efforts to approach comprehensive escapement sampling in future years. 5) Continue these genetic sampling efforts to derive parentage-based tags for returning adults from both hatchery-origin and natural-origin production. 6) Estimate RRS in SEP hatcheries to allow improved management of genetic risks associated with hatchery influences.

2024-2025,2452,Genetic associations with age of return in male Canadian Chinook Salmon,PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,"Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband",Approved,"Chinook Salmon display arguably the widest range of life history strategies of all Pacific salmonids. One important life history strategy in male Chinooks is to return after one fewer year in the marine environment than the earliest returning females. These early-returning males or “jacks” are relatively small, and participate in spawning by employing an opportunistic “sneaker” strategy to fertilize small numbers of eggs from many spawning events involving females and larger, more dominant, males. In general, spawning success in Chinook Salmon is closely related to size; however, jacks experience the risk marine predation for at least one less year than other males, and the success of jacks is a product of negative frequency-dependent selection. In other words, as the proportion of large males increases, the relative success of jacks increases, whereas as the proportion of jacks increases, the relative success of jacks decreases. In addition, from an evolutionary perspective jack males represent an important natural avenue of gene flow between different spawning years in Pacific salmon species. Therefore, the natural occurrence of low frequencies of jack males in Chinook Salmon populations is likely beneficial for the population and species as a whole. There are both genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the tendency of a male Chinook to return as a jack, and current understanding suggests that growth rates at early life stages combined with size-at-age thresholds play key roles in the likelihood of observing the jack phenotype later in life. These factors suggest that hatchery enhancement may artificially raise the proportion of jack males in a population, and this has been observed in some hatchery lines. Despite the importance of the jack life history strategy overall, there is no doubt that larger Chinook males are more successful on the spawning grounds, and larger salmon are more valuable to fisheries. Consequently, there are concerns that hatchery enhancement may shift the distribution of ages of return towards younger age classes with negative consequences for both harvest and population-level fitness. To mitigate the risk of shifting a population’s average age of return, hatcheries may manage jacks in broodstock differently than other males by preferentially retaining older males. The jack phenotype is known to be inherited to a reasonable extent, and thus this broodstock screening should counter the likelihood of overrepresentation of jack fathers in hatchery-origin offspring. However, as genetic and environmental factors impact the tendency to jack, broodstock management would be improved and facilitated if jacks among the potential brood could be screened specifically for the genetic factors underlying the jack phenotype; these factors are the most likely to directly impact the proportion of jacks in the subsequent generation of hatchery-origin offspring. Recent research has shown that specific y-chromosome haplotypes are strongly associated with the tendency of a male to return as a jack, but these haplotypes are unique to different regions. Y-chromosome haplotypes in Canadian Chinook Salmon have not be characterized in the context of ages of return for any population, impairing the ability to develop genetic tools to refine hatchery broodstock management. Therefore, resolving the genetic variants responsible for known inheritance of the jack life history strategy is an important step in improving genetic hatchery management in the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Identify males of known age classes from previously genotyped broodstock from three Chinook populations enhanced by SEP (confirmed populations: Chilliwack River Fall, Puntledge River Fall and Qualicum River). 2) Perform reduced-representation sequencing on 256 males from each population across age classes with approximately 80 jacks per population. 3) Analyze genotype-phenotype associations between genetic variants and the age of return among individuals, including a specific analysis of y-chromosome haplotypes. The long-term objectives of the study are: 4) Expand these analyses to include additional SEP-enhanced Chinook populations from other regions to confirm the generality of genetic associations. 5) Design genetic tools to allow rapid screening of genetic variants that have large effects on the tendency of a male Chinook to return as a jack. 6) Potentially expand these analyses to examine genetic associations with age of return in female Chinook, which would also support genetic management of SEP broodstocks.

However, there are also risks associated with hatchery enhancement; differences between a hatchery and a natural habitat affect both the genetic and environmental factors that shape the performance and fitness of salmon. Consequently, hatchery-origin salmon may be less suited to wild habitats than their natural-origin counterparts, and the presence of hatchery-origin fish on a natural spawning ground may reduce the fitness of a population overall. Despite the known risks and consequences of hatchery enhancement, major genetic differences between hatchery-origin and natural-origin salmonids as a result of hatchery-mediated selection or relaxed selection have generally not been observed in integrated populations. In contrast, substantial epigenetic differences have been detected between hatchery-origin and natural-origin Pacific salmonids. Epigenetic variants are structural changes to DNA without a change in the DNA sequence itself. For example, DNA methylation is a commonly studied epigenetic mechanism in which a methyl group (-CH3) is covalently added to a cytosine residue. These modifications to DNA can alter the function of the genome, particularly through the regulation of gene expression. Given the extent of variation in epigenetic signatures between hatchery-origin and natural-origin salmon, the functional effects of epigenetic variants are excellent candidates to underlie the fitness consequences associated with hatchery enhancement. Additionally, it is possible for hatchery epigenetic variants to be inherited by the offspring of hatchery-origin fish, which aligns with the potential for long-term reductions in population fitness as hatchery-origin fish spawn in natural habitats. The study of epigenetic variation in Pacific salmonids is relatively in its infancy, but epigenetic biomarkers are a promising tool to facilitate managing hatchery enhancement specifically and salmon fisheries generally. A critical knowledge gap in the generation of these tools is that epigenetic differences between hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook Salmon have not been well-characterized within enhanced populations or across populations enhanced by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). Therefore, a comprehensive examination of DNA methylation between hatchery- and natural-origin Canadian Chinook Salmon is a high priority, which will be followed by the development of epigenetic biomarkers and tools for monitoring and management.

The objective of this specific project is to compile historic juvenile Sockeye Salmon size, condition, abundance, and annual migration timing information, from associated raw data, for an estimated two dozen study-lake research projects directed by various DFO programs led by Dr. Kim Hyatt since 1977 (e.g., Lake Enrichment Program (LEP), Enhancement Assessment Unit (EAU), Juvenile Salmon Index Surveys (JSIDs). Raw and life-stage specific summary data will be compiled into a user-friendly database and made available to internal (DFO) and external organizations via the Open Data Portal. The database that will store these data will be searchable and will use optical character recognition (OCR) to rescue data without having to open and read each scanned or digitally retrieved file. Where OCR cannot assess hand written notes, the original scan is kept. The main objective is data rescue to preserve historic data that are at risk of loss. Specific deliverables include: i. A user-friendly menu-driven forms-based MS-Access relational database, with built-in queries for annual summary reports and export to other programs (e.g., Open Data); and ii. One or more Canadian Data Reports of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, with annual summary tables and plots for life-stage specific size, abundance, and migration timing details. iii) A variety of management questions may be addressed by having these data consolidated and preserved. These include (a) providing baseline data for evaluation of changes due to climate change, (b) providing baseline data for improving understanding of local ecosystems, and (c) providing Area managers with historical maximum and minimum salmon abundances within their Areas, from which it is possible to better determine escapement and harvest goals.

It is worth noting that this data rescue effort can facilitate other projects or work that would be dependent on these data such as the analyses of climate effects on salmon ecosystems over time, management of local populations of salmon (e.g., escapement targets, harvest quotas), Species at Risk work, Sockeye Index Stocks (Cam Freshwater), habitat improvement or remediation planning, and marine shipping disaster preparedness (e.g., provide spatio-temporal knowledge of sensitive salmon life stages during migration for Oceans Protection Plan).

2024-2025,2493,Improved understanding of cumulative impacts on salmon survival across freshwater life-stages; tools and approaches for mechanistic assessments,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,"David Patterson, Douglas Braun",Approved,"Context: Landscape level assessments of stressors on aquatic habitats, climate change projections, and population dynamics models can provide cautionary flags that identify potentially stressed or vulnerable watersheds and/or populations (e.g., RPA status assessment, Pacific Salmon Explorer). These approaches are useful for initial watershed or population prioritization. However, in most cases these approaches are limited in their ability to accurately describe the cumulative impact that multiple stressors can have on individuals and specific populations because they lack a mechanistic approach that can verify the complex interacting pathways of effects on fish (Peacock, Braun, Hodgson et al., 2023). This complexity makes it difficult to understand how future landscape alterations and climate change will affect salmon in a given watershed; thus limiting our ability to provide specific advice to managers on how to predict which mitigation or recovery actions (e.g. habitat restoration, harvest reductions) will most effectively recover salmon populations. We propose to link in situ ecophysiology information with other biophysical habitat monitoring data to develop mechanistic relationships that address management issues around habitat-population modeling, assessment of restoration function, and fish responses to climate change. The specific management questions are: Q1) What multi-factor stressors limit stage specific freshwater habitat distribution? Q2) What are the key drivers of stage-specific survival and growth for life-cycle modelling? Q3) What is the role of temperature in combination with other key factors in predicting climate change impacts on salmon growth and survival in a given habitat (e.g. lake, river, wetlands)? Q4) What are major habitat factors that affect salmon growth and survival to consider in planning and assessment of habitat mitigation, restoration, and offsetting effectiveness? The proposal is to execute a series of projects that directly address these management questions through two main outcomes 1) improved understanding of cumulative effects, and co-development of 2) tools and approaches to guide future mechanistic assessments of cumulative impacts. Improve Understanding: For year 1 & 2, we propose to continue work on cumulative impact projects: 1) development of in situ stage specific mechanistic relationships among biophysical factors (dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, flow, conspecific competition), distribution, physiological condition metrics, growth, and survival for juvenile salmonids – all measure in situ, 2) continue to develop and evaluate ecophysiology tools related to evaluating fish condition. Life-stage specific mechanistic relationships will be examined using samples in-hand from three large scale field programs (Lakes, E-Watch, North Thompson Salmon Ecosystem Program) within the Freshwater Ecosystems Section. All three programs generate unique multi-year population data on multiple biophysical factors influencing juvenile salmon condition, growth, and survival such as, water quality, conspecific density, temperature, food availability, primary productivity, DO and water level in lakes, wetlands, and flows in rivers. Models examining the effects of multiple biophysical factors on condition will be used to understand how interacting biophysical drivers (including stressors) shape fish condition, while models examining relationships between condition metrics and growth and/or survival will examine the use of condition metrics as tools to indicate future salmon presence, growth and survival. Concomitant lab work is ongoing to support the development of ecophysiology tools, such as growth hormones (IgF) for freshwater salmon growth, troponin for oxygen stress, and triglycerides (TAG) for nutritional status, that can be used as potential indicators of habitat quality. For Year 3&4 we will use the results from year 1&2 to identify and test key knowledge gaps on cumulative effects in salmon (e.g. Iacarella proposal). This selection of multifactor field experiments could include: low DO and high temperature; food availability, temperature, and growth/survival; pH and temperature tolerance experiments with preference/avoidance behaviour studies; and temperature and migratory stressors on in-river survival Sockeye/Chinook/Coho. This project is distinct from related PSSI proposals in that we are proposing a mechanistic approach to test the cumulative impact of multiple factors directly on individual fish response (i.e. growth, survival, stress) in their native habitats, leveraging multiple program expertise both within the freshwater section and beyond. Our experience is that science advice to major management decisions are best supported by a mechanistic understanding how environmental and physiological processes directly impact fish themselves. This is foundational work that can then be used to generate population responses were appropriate. However, we acknowledge that not all management questions to science require such an in-depth experimental approach, which is why we are proposing the guideline development to help managers and researchers prioritize how best to approach assessing cumulative impacts, as well as work with the other related projects. The proposal is complementary to other PSSI science proposals in that we are addressing similar questions, but at different spatial scales (e.g. Iacarella’s broad region-wide scale) and biological levels of organization. The work also complements broad-scale modeled predictions of discharge, temperature, and DO, that can be used with our mechanistic relationships to generate robust predictions of fish responses to climate change. More specifically, we will help test some of key stressor interactions that emerge as pervasive across the province from Iacarells’s proposal with field-based studies. We will directly link the outputs from Naman’s model of habitat suitability with direct measures of fish condition, fish performance and survival (i.e. a form of cross validation). We will work with Czembor’s group to share ideas on the state of knowledge of key limiting factors, and evaluate fit-chips as a potential ecophysiological tool from the Miller proposal. Tools and Approaches: We will synthesize approaches and our results to develop a pragmatic guide for initiating mechanistic cumulative effects investigations. We started with a literature review (Y1-2) of current methods for assessing physiological condition, as an integrated measure of habitat quality. The review will examine the benefits and limitations of these different physiological condition metrics and span metrics that include genomic, transcriptomic (fitchips), proteins (e.g. hormones, enzymes), metabolites (TAGs, ions), and phenotypes (size). This verification of physiological tools will be done in conjunction with assessing different habitat monitoring and modelling approaches (e.g. Cunningham 2022; Naman proposal) to verify Value of Information. For Year 3 & 4\. The culmination of the literature review and field/lab projects will be a pragmatic guide for a tiered approach (i.e. opinions, reviews, observations, hypothesis testing, quantification of uncertainty) to initiate mechanistic cumulative effects investigations that directly link to management advice (Patterson et al. 2016). The guide can be used to develop in-depth monitoring programs where watersheds or populations are flagged by broad scale analyses as stressed or at risk (Iacarella proposal).

Over the past year our 6PPD-quinone (6PPD-q) field program has been working to characterize the presence of the toxic tire derived chemical 6PPD-q at 32 sites in salmon bearing creeks in the greater Vancouver area, Squamish and Vancouver Island before, during, and after rain events. The sample collection has been carried out with help from World Fisheries Trust, Peninsula Streams Society, and the Musqueam, Tsleil-Waututh, Tsawwassen, and Cowichan First Nations. Preliminary data from the greater Vancouver area in 2022 showed significantly higher levels of 6PPD-q in creeks during rainfall events, with levels approaching or exceeding expected effects levels and lethality in coho salmon. The goal of the proposed project is to build on these findings by 1) collecting water samples at 10 new priority sites in salmon bearing creeks; 2) assessing 6PPD-quinone levels temporally before, during, and after a rain event at a reduced number of priority sites; 3) characterizing the removal of 6PPD-quinone from stormwater green infrastructure. This project will deliver new data on 6PPD-quinone levels in salmon bearing creeks in coastal British Columbia. This study will provide enabling information to PSSI and fisheries managers as they aim to curb historic declines in Pacific salmon, particularly coho salmon which are highly sensitive to this chemical, and enable their recovery.

2024-2025,2522,Explanation for the Collapse of the Commercial Chum Salmon Fishery in British Columbia,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Chrys Neville,Under review,"The commercial chum fishery in British Columbia has collapsed. The fishery, that averaged about 15,000 t between 1950-1989, declined sharply since 2010 and in 2022 was only 180 t. The catch in 2023 appears to be as low or lower. In addition to the collapse of the fishery, there is a collapse of escapements. Atlas et al (2022) reported an 80-90% collapse in spawning chum salmon abundance in Central Coast rivers since 1960. The Fraser River, historically the largest producer of Chum salmon in BC, may not reach targeted escapement for 2023 despite not allowing any fishing. Additionally, targeted chum escapements for numerous other rivers flowing into the Strait of Georgia appear to be alarmingly low in 2023. These declines in chum salmon are as equally, or even more alarming, as the collapse of southern BC coho salmon escapements in the 1990s that resulted in the closure of key fisheries. The dramatic declines of chum salmon have not only impacted commercial fisheries, historically the most important salmon fishery by weight in BC, but declines have significant implications to First Nations. Additionally, Hanson et al (2001) demonstrated that chum salmon were 2 to 3 times more important in the diet than Chinook salmon during the fall and early winter for “southern resident killer whales” adding an additional concern for the protection of southern resident killer whales.

The reasons for the declines in chum salmon are not understood and not studied. We have 25 years of juvenile chum catches in the Strait of Georgia and three years of catches of British Columbia chum salmon in the winter in the Gulf of Alaska that we can use to develop hypotheses to explain why declines are occurring and what might be done to manage existing populations to maximize future production as ocean ecosystems change.

There is no trend in the catches of juvenile chum salmon in the juvenile salmon surveys conducted by the Salmon Marine Interactions Program in the Strait of Georgia for the past 25 years indicating that the number of juveniles entering the ocean has not declined. However, there has been no stock specific DNA analysis completed for the juvenile chum salmon catches in these surveys in the Strait of Georgia because funds were not available. Surveys in the Gulf of Alaska in the winter of 2019, 2020 and 2020 were the first studies of Canadian chum salmon during the winter. DNA and age analysis indicated that although Canadian chum salmon in their first winter in the ocean were encountered, there were very few Canadian chum salmon in their 2nd, 3rd or 4th winters. However, these older age classes were encountered for chum salmon that originated from Alaska, Russia and Japan. Therefore, results from the winter expeditions and results from the juvenile salmon surveys suggest that recent declines occur before or about the time of the first ocean winter.

This project will produce stock specific juvenile abundances of chum salmon in the summer and fall survey catches in the Strait of Georgia. These abundances will be used to determine if there are stock specific trends in abundance over the 25 years of sampling or stock specific patterns of juveniles remaining in the Strait of Georgia through their first marine summer. The stock specific abundances will also be compared to the stock composition of chum in the catches from our winter surveys in the Gulf of Alaska. Resulting relationships with survey abundance trends, escapements, hatchery production, stock specific growth and condition will be used to develop hypotheses for possible causes of the decline in ocean survival of BC chum salmon and what can be done to maximize survival in the future of changing ocean ecosystems.

2024-2025,2534,Understanding the impact of Arctic outflow winds on British Columbia fjords.,PSSI (B-base),Climate Change and Oceans,Jennifer Jackson,Submitted,"There are times during most winters that Arctic air masses settle over the British Columbia (BC) interior east of the coast mountain range. Some of this cold air is transported to the coast as an outflow wind via coast mountain valleys. In Bute Inlet, it has been shown that these outflow winds can cool the upper 100 m up to 1.9°C and gain up to 4.1 mLL -1 of oxygen (Jackson et al., 2023). Colder, more oxygenated waters can persist for up to 1 year in Bute Inlet after the outflow event, which could create a marine refugia. To understand whether this process impacts other fjord systems, a PhD student (Ehsan Tighizadeh) who is jointly situated int he Natural Resources and Environmental Studies Graduate Program at the University of Northern British Columbia and Fisheries and Oceans Canada will expand this study to cover the entire British Columbia coast. Specifically, they will reconstruct the historical climatology of Arctic outflow winds and their impact on fjord waters along the BC coast. Through this work, it is anticipated that other marine refugia created by Arctic outflow winds will be identified.

Oceanographers in DFO and other departments such as ECCC have collaborated in the development of ocean models that can be used to assess future changes in the environment for salmon and other fish species. However, there is a significant 'scale gap' between the global, coarse resolution Earth System Models used to generate climate projections and the high-resolution (e.g., 3 km) models used to downscale these projections for coastal and shelf environments. This gap can be filled by basin-scale models at 1/12 to 1/4 degree. The present research plans to build on existing efforts funded under CSRF to conduct simulations of projected future climates at these intermediate scales. In this way we will create an 'envelope of possibilities' of future environments for salmon in the oceanic environment.

The main anticipated outcomes from this work are (1) development of a capacity to downscale climate projections at intermediate scale, including biogeochemistry (e.g., oxygen concentration), and (2) generation of data products that can used for Species Distribution Modelling of salmon in the oceanic environment.

In 2024-2025, we will focus on 
- Supporting cross Branch coordination on data
- Strengthening Science-management interface through mapping the data to decisions landscape
- Developing local and international data standards
- Building historical datasets on salmon including historical impacts
- Build regional capacity for data stewardship

#### Support cross-branch coordination on data
As a technical lead on many of DFO's datasets, Science has a unique responsibility to help other branches design, collect, analyze and maintain their data assets.  Increasingly, there is a need to integrate across those datasets, align efforts on new cross-branch initiatives and come up with new research that makes use of these data. Our program aims to support cross-branch integration and collaboration on data through delivery of focused data products, including
- developing governance and stewardship models for cross-branch data assets such as escapement, genetics, biotraits and others
- Plan a symposium and workshop for the American Fisheries Society focused on developing salmon vocabulary and ontology for research and management.
- developing shared controlled vocabularies and ontologies that enable easier integration between these datasets. 
- Aligning these controlled vocabularies with international standards
- developing data discovery and integration tools based on these vocabularies

#### Data Stewardship Unit Support
Pacific Region has many outdated data processes that will require modernization or fixing to support the new kinds of data and decisions DFO needs to make.  Working with FADS, the Knowledge mobilization unit will help design and establish a Data Stewardship Unit by:
- identifying key deliverables that would support improved data life cycle processes for salmon data in the region
- Identifying capacity needed to meet these deliverables
- Assessing feasibility of various implementation options with Area staff, CDOS, PSSI
- Supporting the hiring process
- Helping new DSU staff to integrate with existing Salmon data processes


####Strengthen coordination of Management and Science through improved understanding of decision needs
-  work with FM and SEP to Define decisions related to Salmon ecosytem management, hatchery management and harvest management
- identify linkages between those decision processes in terms of where their outcomes may interact with other decision processes
- collaboratively identify Performance indicators needed to address those decision needs
- Describe data sources needed to address those decision needs
- Describe possible methods for achieving those data sources. 
- Link potential data sources to existing or needed data collection activities.

#### Digitization of paper data forms into digital records
Recording of field data on paper creates a significant backlog in the data process.  To learn how to remove this bottleneck and apply solutions to present-day systems, we are 
- Applying paper processing pipeline to other data assets including FM and SEP data
- Continue to extract and analyze historical environmental data from BC 16 documents
- Apply the processing pipeline to contemporary SIL data

#### Deploying tablets in field-based data collection activities.
Many field activities use paper to collect data, resulting in divergent and low-quality raw data sources that requires significant transformation and harmonization effort to align with other similar sources. At the same time, significant technical barriers prevent adoption of modern tablet-based digitization methods, mostly related to IT security and accessibility policies. We will work with area staff and CDOS on a Proof of concept  implementing tablets in field data collection activities to understand how tablets could be scaled up to support region-wide adoption.
- Establish scope for PoC
- source form software and support field staff to adopt
- work with CDOS to define and evaluate success criteria
- Report on results of the PoC
- develop guidelines for implementation that could apply to other programs.

#### Harmonizing divergent data processes
- Document and merge DFO monitoring methods with other Agencies including USGS, NOAA
- Publish open-source ontology for Salmon data
- Publish Rich metadata standards for salmon monitoring methods
-  Implement generative AI tools to support cleaning of existing metadata elements so they become rich metadata
- Develop analyses to identify linkages between monitoring methods and help establish best practices

#### Understand outcomes of decision processes
The outcomes of decisions are rarely coordinated with one another, meaning that those decisions operate in isolation from one another.  at the same time, those decisions often have intersecting or conflicting outcomes. As well, it is frequently difficult to understand how one might benefit from understanding prior decision contexts.

Since then, national objectives and interest in continuing these expeditions have changed and there is currently no uptake for more synoptic trawl surveys. The momentum obtained through NPAFC International Year of the Salmon projects, such as the High Seas expeditions, is being directed to the joint NPAFC-PICES UNDOS Science Program on “Basin-Scale Events to Coastal Impacts” (BECI). BECI is still in the Science Plan Development stage, but has full support from DFO and a March 2023 workshop has outlined a framework foreward with an Implementation Plan to be next outlined. BECI will focus on MODELLING and MONITORING with advanced technologies (e.g. gliders) for the Pacific Basin (i.e. High Seas) and linked to coastal ecosystems. BECI is intended to be applied to multiple species of interest in the basin or in coastal waters; but salmon will be the exemplar with initial modelling to focus on salmon requirements. The first portion of the modelling identified by the March 2023 workshop is climate downscaling to spatial resolutions that can link to existing coastal environmental and salmon data. The linkage between freshwater-coastal-high seas in the life cycle of salmon is another important modelling component. A DFO-NOAA initiative exists focusing on life cycle modeling for Columbia River Chinook salmon, but those salmon do not fully utilize high seas habitat. The opportunity exists to complement this initiative with similar life cycle modeling for a species (stock) that does utilize the high seas, such as Sockeye salmon or Coho salmon. It is anticipated that research supporting BECI will begin in 2024; we propose to use PSSI High Seas Salmon research and salary funds to support and initiate work to align with BECI and position DFO to be a strong participant.

In the 2024/25 fiscal year funds are sought to support an EG04 and transition to one juvenile salmon program, functionally combining the WCVI and Strait of Georgia survey programs for one Pacific juvenile salmon program.

It will also tie in a recent SOS report on climate change adaptation: https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/41213531.pdf

With the publishing of DFO's rapid status approach to assess status and limit reference points (LRPs), we will use this Scanner as the foundation of SOS reporting. DFO's Scanner is an interactive data visualization tool that presents salmon WSP status and trends information within a mapping interface. By using the Scanner we can compare and contrast salmon CU trends in the Pacific Region. Currently Fraser salmon CUs and select North coast and southern BC Chinook CUs are available in the Scanner. Information provided by experts, combined with their use of the Scanner results will form the foundation on state of salmon reporting. Including First Nations observations will be an additional objective of the SOS reporting. How to include Western Science and Indigenous knowledge as two separate streams of knowledge will be explored. The report will provide trends and statuses and key narratives on the State of Pacific Salmon. This extends on annual reporting that has been done through State of the Pacific Ocean (salmon trends) and the Integrated Fisheries Management Plans (IFMPs) for environmental conditions for the upcoming return year.

These data are critical for managers to best allocate limited resources, focusing recovery efforts on salmon populations best aligned with future salmon production and diversity. Climate change already affects Canadian Pacific salmon and their ecosystems, with impacts expected to accelerate.

Climate change vulnerability assessments (CCVAs) are important tools to support management decisions, providing summaries of the relative threat level for a population from climate change. These assessments integrate expert knowledge on salmon, their ecosystems, and climate change projections, and have been successfully applied to U.S. Pacific salmon populations, but are currently lacking for Canadian Pacific salmon.

We will apply the U.S. CCVA framework to Canadian Pacific salmon. These assessments will be conducted for two groups of salmon populations to provide a toolkit for conducting salmon CCVA’s for the 377 Conservation Units (CUs) of salmon DFO manages across all five species (Sockeye, Chinook, Coho, Pink and Chum). These two case studies will include CUs with the greatest risk of extinction, since these CUs will urgently require climate vulnerability information to support management decisions.

2024-2025,2572,Assessing Salinity Alteration of Nursery Conditions for Salmon Smolts following Construction of Roberts Bank Terminal-2,PSSI (B-base),Aquatic Animal Health,Terri Sutherland,Submitted,"Millions of Fraser River salmon rely on Roberts Bank tidal flats for food, shelter, and salinity acclimatization before they undergo a multi-year migration across the Pacific Ocean for many years. Since harpacticoids provide a link between primary production (benthic diatom biofilms) and tertiary production at higher trophic levels (salmon-smolts, sandpipers), harpacticoids can transfer diatom-derived a high-quality food consisting of long-chain polysaccharide unsaturated fatty-acids (LC-PUFAs) that serve as a high-quality migration fuel for salmon smolts. However, modelling scenarios of salinity estimates on Roberts Bank shows a salinity regime shift towards freshwater 34% relative to that of the existing tidal flats conditions between pre- and post-construction of Roberts Bank Terminal-2 (RBT2). On Roberts Bank, the alignment of diatom-harpacticoid-salmon trophic levels and transfer of LC-PUFAs across trophic levels must be sustained to avoid a potential “match–mismatch” scenario (McKinnell and Irvine, 2021). This timely pairing of predator and prey is also crucial for 1.5 million Western sandpipers (Caldris mauri), that migrate between Panama to Alaska annually (April 15 – May 15) and stopover on Roberts Bank tidal flats. Western sandpipers also rely on diatom biofilms (LC-PUFAs) for fuel for the long migration to Alaska (Warnock and Bishop, 1998; Elner et al, 2005; Kuwae et al. 2008; Mathot et al. 2010). Given the overlap of 1) migration stopover location and timing for both salmon and sandpipers on Roberts Bank; and 2) similar prey preferences (benthic diatom biofilms) and required LC-PUFAs for migration fuel, a competitive interaction may occur under these circumstances, leading to a match-mismatch scenario for both benthic diatom predators. Furthermore, the predicted reduction of salinity due to RBT2 construction during the season of freshet and migration stopovers of both salmon and sandpiper, may apply a significant environmental stressor to this competition for high-quality food.

We will accomplish this by experimentally manipulating rearing conditions at PSEC to link aspects of hatchery rearing environments with epigenetic patterns and assess downstream functional consequences (gene expression). Specifically, we have reared Coho Salmon in contrasting environmental conditions in the lab trying to isolate various factors that differ between hatchery and natural environments. The three treatment factors are water source (well vs. untreated creek water), feed (standard aquaculture pellets vs. simulated natural food (mysis and bloodworms)), and tank environment (unenriched tanks vs. semi-natural stream tanks with gravel substrate and vegetation). All possible combinations of factors are represented. We will conduct whole epigenome sequencing of samples collected from all treatment groups to identify which experimental factors have the greatest influence on DNA methylation. We will compare the specific regions that are differentially methylated among our experimental treatments with differences observed between hatchery and natural origin fish. The research will provide information on which aspects of hatchery environments may be most effective to manipulate to reduce divergence between hatchery and natural origin fish.

2024-2025,3104,Establishing a feed assessment program in Pacific salmon enhancement hatcheries,PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,Ian Forster,Submitted,"Fish feed is critically important to fish growth, physiological functioning and fish health, and a major budget item for salmonid enhancement facilities in BC (~ overall 1 million CAD/year). Feed is a perishable item, however. The quality will change if feed is exposed to air, adverse conditions, or prolonged storage time. Ingredients including proteins, lipids, vitamins, and pigments are heat- and moisture-sensitive. Feed can degrade and become conducive to mold growth when exposed to extended periods of high temperature and/or humid conditions. Moreover, there has been significant refinement in fish feed formulations to partially replace finite and expensive marine ingredients, such as fish meal and fish oil, with less costly, possibly more sustainable, and more stable supplies of terrestrial ingredients; these may not necessarily be suitable for growing fish for enhancement purpose (Colombo and Turchini 2021). The quality of marine ingredients also fluctuates with the increasingly unpredictable ocean conditions. These, and other, uncertainties highlight the need to establish a feed sampling program to verify feed quality and relay potential concerns to suppliers such that rapid improvements can be made.

In the past, SEP collaborated with the DFO Fish Nutrition Lab (then under Dr. David Higgs), located in West Vancouver. Dr. Higgs was an expert in understanding nutritionally related fish mortality events. As an example, he was involved in identifying the role of zinc deficiency on Chinook cataract development (Richardson et al. 1985). His laboratory was also instrumental in providing feed quality assessments through the 1990’s and early 2000’s and the analytical support program for assessing SEP’s feed supplies at West Vancouver Laboratory (now the Pacific Science Enterprise Centre, PSEC) ended with Dr. Higgs’ retirement, close to two decades ago. In contrast, the US Fish and Wildlife Service agency (Abernathy Fish Technology Center) examines fish feed received by enhancement hatcheries located in the US Pacific Regions and generates a quarterly report by probing into feed proximate composition (protein, fat, ash, moisture) and rancidity related parameters (peroxide value, free fatty acids, thiobarbituric acid). It is not uncommon that the results show deviations in fat and protein contents and elevated rancidity levels (oil degradation) relative to the manufacturer ingredient label and quality standard (i.e. Fish feed quality control report 2024). The goal here is to establish a feed sampling program to provide advice (feed quality/storage) for salmon enhancement facilities in BC, and communicate the results internally and externally, and to assess the viability of a long-term feed quality assessment program.

2024-2025,3107,Scenario Planning: improving the adaptability of Pacific salmon hatchery planning and implementation to current and future climate changes,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Modelling & Decision Support,"Sue Grant, Bronwyn MacDonald, Lenora Turcotte, David Willis",Submitted,"The problem: Climate change is creating a more volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world. How do hatchery managers move forward despite these uncertainties and overcome “management paralysis” in the context of climate change?

What is being proposed: We will use scenario planning to develop insight into how SEP/DFO can better ensure that hatchery planning and implementation is adaptable to climate change impacts over the next 20 years. Year 1 will focus on a DFO internal process and plan for broader engagement in Year 2 with Indigenous knowledge experts.

Scenario planning enables organizations to embrace uncertainty by expanding their understanding of the plausible range of futures they may experience. Scenarios are meant to guide and inform organizations about potential future changes that will impact how they operate. These processes enable organizations to be better positioned to deal with unexpected threats, and take advantage of unexpected opportunities.

Scenario planning is a structured approach for defining plausible futures. This is a co-learning participatory process, that has been identified as a key way to advance climate adaptation within organizations and processes (Hare 2020). Expertise provided by DFO Science, SEP, Indigenous groups, and other Sectors will be integrated through this process.

Scenario planning identifies areas of high impact and low predictability within a system, and imagines future situations, termed scenarios, that could occur given the uncertainties identified. Large-scale driving forces that may push the future in different directions are identified and used to uncover potential future states. Scenarios provide a fresh perspective, and a new framework that can be used to encourage dialogue and strategic thinking on the challenges and opportunities we may face. It is a powerful tool for forcing us to challenge commonly-held assumptions and expectations, and abandon previously fixed ideas that may no longer hold true. Scenarios help by legitimizing a dialogue, challenging conventional wisdom, initiating widespread discussion, and creating the possibility of genuine transformation.

Participants in scenario planning processes identify and evaluate management options or adaptations that are robust to alternate plausible future scenarios. In this way, scenario planning can help managers understand where management strategies may need to change to prepare for the future. This work can also prioritize knowledge gaps and future science priorities.

Scenario planning is a flexible process that can be tailored to the specific project goals and objectives. Generally, processes follow five steps described by Frens and Morrison (2020): 1\. Orientation to the problem: define the specific issue being discussed, goals, scope, and desired outcomes. 2\. Exploration: improve understanding of the issue, identify key drivers and uncertainties. 3\. Scenario building: identify critical uncertainties (drivers) for the scenario framework, develop plausible scenario narratives. 4\. Application: examine scenarios for implications, develop and evaluate management actions. 5\. Identify indicators: specifically, environmental indicators and thresholds that would trigger recommended management strategies.

Collaboration with another ESD-SEP PSSI Proposal: this work links with ESD proposal led by Chrys Neville: “Assessing the impact of modifications to hatchery release strategies of Chinook salmon on their distribution and marine survival’ though engaging scientific expertise and knowledge that can support scenario planning process to identify hatchery adaptation robust to future climate change scenarios.

2024-2025,3119,Genomic consequences of stray hatchery introgression,PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,"Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband",Submitted,"The objective of this project is to assess and understand the genetic consequences of interbreeding of hatchery strays into non-native populations of Chinook Salmon. Pacific salmon populations are known to display local adaptation, such that native spawners are typically better suited to their local habitat than non-native spawners. This can be exacerbated for strays from populations that are integrated with hatchery enhancement, because hatchery adaptation can further reduce fitness in natural environments. Previous work on West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook Salmon has demonstrated that strays from several major production facilities have interbreed with natural populations in other rivers, resulting in introgression of hatchery genetic variation and homogenization of population-level variation. This work was conducted in the mid-2010s and utilized only ~12-15 genetic biomarkers, providing low density estimates of this introgression. Low density estimates may mischaracterize the extent of introgression, and cannot inform either the repeatability of introgression, or the potential maladaptive consequences across different genomics regions. In this project, we propose to update the estimates of introgression from Robertson Creek and Conuma River Hatcheries among WCVI Chinook Salmon populations, and to assess introgression with a high-density genomic sequencing strategy to provide high resolution estimates of hatchery introgression. The results of this work will inform advice processes regarding management of hatchery strays and adaptive influences at levels above individual populations (e.g., conservations units).

2024-2025,3120,Genetic and epigenetic consequences of hatchery adaptation,PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,"Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband",Submitted,"Adaptation to hatchery environments is known to reduce the fitness of Pacific salmon in their natural habitats. However, in integrated hatchery populations, such as those operated by the Salmonid Enhancement Program, there is typically limited genetic differentiation between hatchery- and natural-origin spawners as a result of gene flow between the two habitats. As a results, the genetic variation responsible for hatchery adaptation is generally poorly resolved. Captive brood programs maintain spawners in the hatchery environment through their entire lifespan. This independence from natural spawners should amplify signatures of hatchery adaptation. The objective of this project is to leverage historical sampling of captive Sockeye Salmon broods in the Pacific Region to characterize the genetics architecture of hatchery adaptation. Beginning from ~2000, samples from two captive broods (Cultus and Sakinaw Lakes) will be sequenced with high-density genomic sequencing to identify changes in the frequencies of genetic variants throughout the duration of the captive brood programs. These data will be paired with epigenetic sequencing understand the contributions of DNA methylation to domestication within captive broods, and the relationship between genetic adaptation and epigenetic differentiation between hatchery- and natural-origin fish. These links are key to the project as epigenetic variation between hatchery- and natural-origin salmon is thought to play a large role in the effects of hatcheries even in integrated populations. Finally, high-density sequencing results will be compared with parallel low-density assessments of genetic variation in the captive broods to validate the performance of low-density markers in assessing and monitoring genetic diversity through time in captive brood and populations of conservation concern.

2024-2025,3121,Impact of genetic divergence on outbreeding depression in Chinook Salmon,PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,"Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband",Submitted,"Abundances of many Chinook Salmon populations are in decline. In extreme cases of these declines, local populations are at the risk of extirpation, which may suggest intervention through the introduction of spawners from non-native populations (i.e., transplants), which is sometimes termed ""genetic rescue"". Transplanted spawners can provide a demographic boost to declining populations; however, Chinook Salmon display local adaptation, such that non-native spawners may be less fit than native spawners, posing a genetic risk to the native population. Additionally, interbreeding between populations has the potential to expression genetic incompatibilities between populations that also cause a loss of fitness (i.e., outbreeding depression). The consequences of outbreeding in Chinook Salmon are poorly understood, and are highly relevant to best practices for transplantation/genetic rescue. The objectives of the proposed project is to collect gametes from four populations of Chinook salmon displaying a range of genetic differentiation, conduct artificial crosses within and among populations, and assess the hatching success and physiological performance of the offspring from these crosses. We hypothesize that negative outcomes of interbreeding are proportional to the genetic differentiation among populations. A key question addressed by this experiment will be whether or not interbreeding within a conservation unit produces negative fitness outcomes.

2024-2025,3124,A data pipeline to support more rapid calculation of Proportionate Natural Influence,PSSI (B-base),Data Management,Tom Bird,Submitted,"Determining the hatchery contribution to fisheries catch and escapement is crucial to determine the Proportionate Natural Influence (PNI) of a stock. Used to support planning of hatchery activities, allocation of fishing effort and research on stock composition, PNI is calculated by combining a number of potential data sources including genetics, coded wire tags, thermal otolith marks or fin clip recoveries, depending on the availability of data for different stocks. Rapid calculation of PNI is currently confounded by a number of factors including lack of managed data sources, varied analysis processes, and disconnects between fisheries, escapement and hatchery data sources. This project will identify the main barriers to determining PNI, develop a proof of concept data pipeline and highlight where effort at building data management and analysis pipelines will provide greatest benefit. The work will center on two priority areas: Priority 1: Broodstock PBT database: Routine access to PBT results is a known barrier for SEP staff. This project component will develop methods for enabling SEP to access them in a timely manner and suitable format. Deliverables: 1) Process map showing the PBT results needed by SEP staff, current blockers to access and what their needs are for ongoing/routine access 2) Develop proof of concept PBT data results pipeline and portal in collaboration with MGL (in EPro, data lakehouse, github or other) Priority 2: PNI Calculation Pipeline: Building on the understanding of PBT data processes, this component will map the various systems and data sources used to calculate PNI, then propose a standardized decision-tree system using multiple data sources and based on SEP PNI calculation guidelines.

Develop a BC Climate Vulnerability Assessment Tool that measures species' vulnerability to climate change and assists in making decisions about how to protect them.

The overarching objective is to produce estimates of salmon productivity and capacity across relevant stream reaches based on multiple climate scenarios and timeframes to help inform enhancement strategies and potential management and mitigation actions. Results of the proposed research will help identify where specific salmon populations are experiencing threats detrimental to their viability along their freshwater distribution, which threats are estimated to be most limiting to populations, and how this varies under different climate change scenarios and timeframes.

Estimates of fish and fish habitat exposure to 13 threats identified as important by FFHPP and COSEWIC were recently developed by the Freshwater Spatial Ecology Program for the Fraser River Basin (Iacarella et al., approved in CSAS peer-review meeting February 2024). These include anthropogenic activity and landscape disturbance-based threats of Aquatic Invasive Species, riparian disturbance, longitudinal fragmentation (barriers to upstream/downstream passage), latitudinal fragmentation (barriers to floodplains), in stream habitat destruction, flow alteration, human-derived sedimentation, human-derived nutrients, and pollution, and climate change-based threats of high stream flow, low stream flow, flood risk, and high stream temperature. This large-scale geospatial product represents the most comprehensive threat assessment for BC’s freshwater fish habitat to-date, using an extensive suite of best available data and methodologies. The threat scores from the assessment were summarized as additive cumulative threats as a first step.

We propose to select salmon stocks within the Fraser River Basin that are of interest to SEP to refine and apply these quantified threat exposures in a cumulative effects – life cycle modeling framework that has recently been developed for BC, called the Cumulative Effects Model for Prioritizing Recovery Actions (CEMPRA; Bayly et al. 2023). This framework is an advancement of the ‘Joe model’ originally developed to assess cumulative effects on trout populations in Alberta (MacPherson, et al. 2020; MacPherson et al. 2024). The model uses exposure estimates and a combination of literature review and expert elicitation to derive stressor-response curves specific to life history stages of salmon. The spatially explicit exposures and predicted salmon responses are then fed into a life cycle model to produce estimates of productivity and capacity of the system (Bayly et al. 2023). Response curves and life cycle model parameters are generally produced in expert workshops, and an extensive literature review is underway to compile a comprehensive library of response curves for salmon (J. Moore Lab, SFU). The CEMPRA framework further enables scenario testing of how varying levels of threats, such as different climate change projections or sediment loadings, influence productivity and capacity estimates. The results of CEMPRA are particularly useful to make relative comparisons of which salmon stocks and associated streams may be experiencing the highest impacts currently and under future climate conditions.

The proposed work will address the following key objectives for a suite of SEP-identified focal stocks in the Fraser River Basin: 1\. Refine and apply threat exposures developed for the Fraser River Basin for specific application to focal stocks and CEMPRA modeling. 2\. Develop and apply stressor-response curves using threats from Objective 1 and salmon responses derived from available literature reviews and through expert elicitation workshops. 3\. Use CEMPRA to develop cumulative effect scores and apply life cycle models to derive productivity and capacity estimates across relevant stream reaches using stock specific information from available DFO data and expert elicitation workshops. 4\. Explore climate change vulnerability and test scenarios using different climate projections and timeframes, as well as different levels of human activity based threats to inform SEP enhancement strategies and potential management and mitigation actions. 5\. Conduct sensitivity analysis of model inputs to inform uncertainty levels. 6\. Develop maps and figures comparing vulnerability across stocks based on threats and climate change scenarios.

This project will further serve as a template for developing similar products for other stocks in the Fraser River Basin and extending the assessment to other basins in BC.

2024-2025,3188,Characterizing the ecology of watersheds slated for supplementation by conservation hatcheries,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Region Functional Group,"Kristi Saunders, David Patterson, Arthur Bass",Submitted,"  1. Overview PROBLEMS: Pathogen introductions from natural sourced water coming into hatcheries may pose future risk to Stocks of Concern to be supplemented by Conservation Hatcheries: Source water used to culture salmon varies considerably between hatcheries. Some hatcheries have “well” ground water, as well as “natural” stream/river/lake water, sometimes at different depths of the lakes. Water source selection at different life stages will depend on operational considerations unique to each hatchery and production cycle. Hatchery managers are acutely aware that with the natural sourced water, which often comes from systems used by multiple species of salmon and trout, they could be introducing pathogens into their hatcheries every time they change water sources. With the new PSSI “Proactive, modernized, holistic approach to ensure optimal health and condition of Hatchery Production” project, in addition to monitoring hatchery cohorts over the course of production, we were asked by hatchery managers to monitor salmon pathogens in their source water. What we found was that source water was a major contributor to both the infectious health of cultured salmon, but also their susceptibility to stress. What is also clear is that once a pathogen enters a hatchery, under present husbandry practices, it is “everywhere”. It has been argued that because the pathogens being introduced into the hatcheries come from the local natural system, exposure is “natural” for local stocks being cultured for enhancement, and releasing infected fish may not have strong consequences on local wild stocks. However, this same argument cannot be made for Conservation hatcheries, where stocks from distal watersheds are to be produced under a single hatchery umbrella, and then transported to supplement watersheds where wild stocks are no longer able to sustain themselves. With the increased reliance on conservation hatcheries, it is imperative to better understanding these risks in order to derive appropriate mitigation measures.  
We propose to develop general baseline metrics of the current status of freshwater ecosystem health for systems slated for future Conservation-based supplementation: As we move towards hatchery supplementation for stocks of concern across a broad reach of watersheds, it has become clear from recent CSAS processes (e.g. Chinook RPAs) that our understanding of watersheds with CUs of conservation concern are often data poor with respect to biodiversity metrics. Many smaller systems are lacking or have imprecise estimates of spawner escapement and limited information on the relevant salmon ecosystems metrics that impact the sustainability of those habitats to support salmon. We are often unable to answer basic ecological questions about salmon freshwater ecosystems, such as: Is there an adequate prey field and does that match the distribution of juvenile salmon? Are there key predators in the system? Are there competitor species that impact the carrying capacity of the system? What pathogens are found, and which do we expect to become more impactful under climate change? We can begin to address these questions with eDNA.  
PROPOSAL: Objective 1: Characterize the state of salmon freshwater ecosystems where stocks of concern are currently enhanced and document changes in biodiversity following hatchery releases. Filtered water samples will be collected from selected locations downstream of spawning grounds and release sites: 1) prior to adult returns (if applicable), 2) during peak spawning (if applicable), 3) immediately prior to juvenile release, and 4) 2-4 weeks after release. eDNA metabarcoding would be applied to characterize salmon/trout distributions within the watersheds, and the distributions of their predators, prey, and competitors. High throughput qPCR monitoring of eDNA/RNA would be applied to salmon and pathogens. qPCR provides a more quantitative measure of relative “abundance” than is available with metabarcoding, which is why we would run salmon with both methods. The number of watersheds and spatiotemporal granularity of sampling could be varied depending on funding. Different watersheds could be monitored in the two years, with the potential to monitor watersheds that are not yet receiving hatchery supplementation solely for the purpose of characterizing the system prior to supplementation. Objective 2: Monitor the microbiome of hatchery conservation populations and how it changes throughout the course of rearing. Using the same technologies identified in Objective 1, we will characterize the pathogen profiles of multiple conservation stocks reared at a single hatchery by sampling: 1) during egg incubation, 2) at regular intervals (1-3 months depending upon production cycle) throughout rearing, and 3) prior to release. Ideally, these populations would match with the watersheds identified in Objective 1. This will provide visualization of the differences in pathogen profiles between populations as they enter the hatchery and how these change among populations throughout rearing. As previous work has demonstrated the apparent importance of rearing water source in pathogen profiles, we will sample the hatchery source waters at each visit. We will also sample the hatchery outflow to determine whether pathogens that enter with broodstock are similar to those detected in the hatchery source water and surroundings.  
For both objectives, we would consider year one to be a “proof of concept”. The scale of the project would be smaller to allow for determination of the scope (site and sample replication) required to characterize a watershed. Lessons learned from year one will facilitate efficient scaling up in year two.

  2. Species, Stock, and Geographic Region: In year two the project would be focused on the Middle and Upper Fraser Watershed, where a conservation hatchery is projected to be established in the next few years to support multiple species and populations. While the initial work could be focused on Fraser Chinook (Spring and Summer 5.2), the sampling protocol is highly flexible and could accommodate investigations into any species or populations of interest and include the following. a. Geographic Area: Fraser Watershed b. Species: Sockeye, Coho, Chinook, Pink, Chum (plus other organisms) c. Salmon Management Unit/Conservation Unit: Pacific Region d. Life Stage: egg, fry, parr, smolt and Adult

In year one, during the proof of concept, we may request to work in watersheds closer to the Vancouver area or on Vancouver Island to facilitate rapid sample processing and more flexibility in methodology and sample timing.

  1. Project Linkages:  
This project will link with the PSSU-SEP project “Proactive, modernized, holistic approach to ensure optimal health and condition of Hatchery Production”, which includes eDNA samples collected in and around hatcheries on Vancouver Island. Data will be compatible for broader, regional comparisons. This project will also link with PSSI Salmon Ecosystem project to D. Patterson on “Improved understanding of cumulative impacts on salmon survival across freshwater life-stages; tools and approaches for mechanistic assessments.”

  2. External Partnerships: We hope to work with researchers from UNBC and SFU. Local First Nations engagement will depend on which specific watersheds are selected. 

  3. Reporting: Annual reports will be produced to document the work that has been done to date and available results. If hatcheries are interested in receiving updates on pathogens detected in cultured populations or source water we can provide additional reporting. We anticipate preparing and submitting a manuscript for peer review. Importantly, the project will also provide a map of relative abundance of detections of juvenile salmon within their freshwater ecosystems, and models that can relate salmon distributions with distributions of prey, predators, pathogens, and competitors. These biological relationships can be contrasted across freshwater ecosystems with high salmon productivity and those where salmon are currently threatened to better understand the biological factors that may undermine ecosystem carrying capacities and recovery. 

  4. Data Products: The datasets on species-specific eDNA results will be stored and secured on established existing Genomics databases within the Molecular Genetics Section, they will be readily shared with SEP, and in due time made publicly available through publication and DFO open data portals. Epicollect will be used for all field collections for seamless integration of field metadata into the existing database.

The population of Boundary Bay Chinook salmon is a relatively small CU of Chinook salmon in the Lower Mainland and prior to brood year (BY) 2021 there was no stock assessment project. In 2014, the Wild Salmon Policy assessed the CK-02 CU as “Data Deficient”. Meanwhile, in 2021, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) identified the population as “Threatened” based on the small population abundance ( < 1000 fish) from the Little Campbell River hatchery fence enumeration data and the severity of habitat threats in the area (COSEWIC 2020). The “Threatened” COSEWIC designation led to consideration for listing under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) and a Recovery Potential Assessment (RPA) for the CU was initiated in 2021 (Dionne et al. 2023). This work prompted the initiation of stock assessment activities to fill data gaps and support rebuilding efforts. The immediate goal of the Little Campbell River Chinook stock assessment program is to increase understanding on the distribution and timing for the Boundary Bay Chinook CU CK-02 population. The long-term goals are to increase knowledge on survival, maturation, and exploitation rates. The Coded-Wire Tag (CWT) recoveries and associated escapement data from this project will improve the understanding of the impacts that the Boundary Bay Chinook CU population is facing and inform recovery planning. The proposed project is to adipose fin clip (AFC) and CWT all Chinook salmon smolt releases from the Little Campbell River Hatchery for BY2024, and implement a AFC/CWT recovery sample collection program. The budget requested is for the AFC and CWT application in March 2025.

2024-2025,3191,Lower Chilcotin Chinook Brood Stock Collection,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,"Lauren Weir, Nicole Trouton, Morgan Dunne",Submitted,"There is no exploitation rate indicator for the Spring 1.3 Chinook Stock Management Unit (SMU), which is required to inform fisheries management decisions. This SMU is currently listed as Red status under the Wild Salmon Policy. Lower Chilcotin Chinook has been identified by the DFO FIA StA and the PST’s CTC to develop as an indicator for this SMU.

Historically, peak count methods using aerial survey data have been used to estimate low precision estimates of Lower Chilcotin Chinook. In 2019, the program transitioned to a high precision sonar method to estimate escapement as part of the development of the Lower Chilcotin Chinook as an indicator stock for the Spring 1.3 (52) Chinook SMU and calibrate the timeseries of escapement data back to 1975. A full deadpitch to determine sex and age composition has been successfully implemented since 2019. The final step to fully develop this into an exploitation rate indicator stock are estimates of exploitation rates and survival, which requires a coded wire tag program including the capture of brood to meet an initial feasibility target of 40,000 adipose fin clipped (AFC) and coded wire tagged (CWT) fed fry. If successful, the long-term goal is for a release of 150,000 AFC and CWT smolts. Brood stock collection for a CWT program started in 2020 and has proven challenging with only 12 fish being captured on the best year.

However, brood collection has not been a primary focus for StA or SEP given financial and staffing limitations. Having dedicated staff focused primarily on the Lower Chilcotin brood collection methodology and implementation is key to the success of this indicator stock. In order to meet this objective we require two Fraser River Stock Assessment technicians (EG 03 and EG 01) to lead this project with support from both StA and SEP. The Lower Chilcotin Chinook brood collection will run for 15-21 days in the late-summer to early-fall.

2024-2025,3210,Constructed off-channel function and effectiveness research,PSSI (B-base),Freshwater Habitat Research,Sean Naman,Submitted,"There are numerous constructed off-channel habitats across the Province. Yet, how these habitats are functioning as fish habitat is not always clear. There is a need to develop standardized approaches to evaluate these habitats to determine whether improvement, or possibly even decommissioning, is needed. More broadly, there is a need to improve our understanding of off-channel habitat function and the conditions necessary for constructed off-channels to provide productive fish habitat. While restoration practitioners may only have capacity to monitor qualitative proxies of habitat function, there is an opportunity for more in-depth investigation ecosystem dynamics and fish productivity in these habitats. This work will partner with the Restoration Centre of Expertise (area and regional staff) and First Nations to investigate fish habitat dynamics in constructed off-channel habitats across the Deadman watershed. Specifically, we will investigate abiotic (e.g., dissolved oxygen, temperature) and biotic conditions (e.g., primary and secondary productivity, fish abundance, growth, and condition) across several constructed off-channels that differ in connectivity to the mainstem, groundwater input, and age.

2025-2026,2394,Enhanced salmon bycatch monitoring and sampling in the Pacific region groundfish trawl fishery,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,"Kathryn Fraser, Cory Lagasse",Submitted,"### Background

The Pacific Region groundfish trawl fishery likely represents the largest source of Pacific salmon catch in a non-salmon directed commercial fishery. While all Pacific salmon species are prohibited in groundfish trawl and cannot be sold or traded, salmon bycatch in trawl fisheries experience high mortality rates and there have been no management measures in place to monitor or mitigate risks to stocks of concern. This sampling program was designed in collaboration between DFO Science, Fisheries Management, industry and monitoring service providers to provide accurate estimates of salmon bycatch by species in the trawl fishery and representative information on Chinook stock composition and indicator stocks.

### Objectives

Initial discussions led to the following four objectives being adopted to guide development of the program: 1\. Accurately estimate the catch in numbers of fish of each salmon species; 2\. Ensure sufficiently accurate and representative CWT sampling to quantify the fishery mortality for Chinook indicator stocks; 3\. Use genetic stock identification (i.e. DNA) where feasible to identify the stock composition of Chinook catch, including for populations that do not have CWT indicator stocks; and 4\. Estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of Chinook catch to determine when and where exploitation on stocks of concern may be occurring.

The program was initiated across for all option A groundfish trawl vessels in September 2022, and will be continued during the 2023/24 fiscal year.

2025-2026,2397,Identifying good practices for considering Indigenous Knowledge in Rebuilding Plan targets and stock assessment reference poi,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Modelling & Decision Support,Carrie Holt,Approved,"The goal of this project is to identify reference points and rebuilding targets for Pacific salmon by pairing Indigenous knowledge systems with Western science within a knowledge co-production paradigm. Knowledge co-production can be defined as “the process of bringing together two different knowledge systems, in true partnership and equity, to enhance, learn, and create new understandings on a specific topic.” (Ellam Yua et al. 2022).

Analytical methods for identifying limit reference points have been developed for Pacific salmon (DFO 2022a) based on Western science, but these have not considered Indigenous Knowledge which was identified as a gap within CSAS review (DFO 2022a, b). ‘Upper stock references’ (delineating ‘critical’ and ‘cautious’ zones of status) and rebuilding targets are components of the DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework and the Fish Stocks provisions under the Fisheries Act, but guidance on identifying them is currently lacking for Pacific salmon. The Fisheries Act further enables the consideration of Indigenous Knowledge in management, such as in the development of rebuilding targets and reference points, but there is limited/no precedents for this for Pacific salmon.

Pairing Indigenous knowledge systems and Western science in the development of reference points and targets is a step towards ensuring that rebuilding is inclusive of Nations’ ontologies, including their definitions for ‘healthy’ and ‘rebuilt’. First Nations have a precedence of knowledge that includes generations of place-based observations that cannot be recreated, or necessarily measured quantitatively. This project, partnered with the Ha’oom Fisheries Society, will explore how to include this alongside or within Western science ideas of status assessment and rebuilding. Methods will be co-created with First Nations partners; we anticipate that they will include a combination of interviews, facilitated discussions, literature reviews, and meta-analyses. In particular, we will identify what levels and attributes are considered ‘healthy’ or ‘rebuilt’ for salmon populations and where ‘serious harm’ is expected to occur, including life-history, distributional, and habitat characteristics.

The project will be co-led with the Five Nations (Ahousaht, Ehattesaht, Mowachaht/Muchalaht, Hesquiaht and Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations) that are represented by the Ha’oom Fisheries Society, with a focus on relationship building and addressing Indigenous needs and values. Bringing Indigenous knowledge systems and Western science together will lead to more equitable and inclusive outcomes, supporting the aims of reconciliation and furthering the capacity for Indigenous self governance. Achieving sustainability of salmon fisheries cannot be achieved through a Western scientific lens alone; incorporating Indigenous Knowledge Systems and a broader perspective on what is considered healthy and serious harm in salmon ecosystems will be essential. The costs in year 1 will be supported in part by Five Nations Funding through DFO’s Treaties and Reconciliation Agreements Program.

2025-2026,2398,WCVI Sediment Transport and Redd Scour Assessment,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Diana McHugh,Approved,"  1. West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschwatcha) populations declined precipitously after the 1990s. Survival rates for naturally spawning WCVI Chinook are now below replacement levels. In 2020, WCVI Chinook was listed as ""Threatened"" by Canada's Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife triggering the Chinook Rebuilding Plan and the marine and freshwater risk assessment (FWRA) processes. Results from the FWRA, highlighted that across the region the incubation life history phase was extremely data deficient. High incubation mortality can reduce productivity and limit the recovery of Chinook salmon populations. A small change in survival during this life history phase can have significant implications on production. Redd scour was identified as a high priority data gap in the indicator watersheds throughout WCVI. The purpose of this study is to evaluate redd scour, sediment transport, and hydrological conditions in three indicator watersheds in Area 23 and Area 24. This study will be important for developing a standard methodology to address this data gap, and for characterizing the scale of the issue. The results will be vital for developing indicators and benchmarks, and to inform restoration, enhancement, and rebuilding measures for WCVI Chinook.

  2. The outcomes of the redd scour study are to: A. Develop a robust methodology to measure redd scour that can be repeated in indicator watersheds across the region; B. Estimate what percentage of redds are scoured at different flow thresholds and how that impacts salmonid mortality during incubation; and, C. Understand what effect more frequent and higher peak flows in a changing climate will have on redd scour and salmonid mortality in the future.

The methodology for the study has three components: I. The installation of a hydrometric station that is calibrated to provide a continuous discharge record for Tranquil Creek and implement a pilot methodology in Tranquil Creek (completed 2022). II. Field surveys in spawning locations that includes cross-sections and sediment size measurements, and the installation of PIT tagged accelerometer scour chains at surveyed locations to measure redd scour; (planned for Sarita [externally funded] and Tranquil in 2023 and Bedwell 2024). III. Pairing bed disturbance data with a 2D hydraulic model to estimate the spatial extent of bed disturbance at a reach scale in key Chinook and chum spawning areas. (Planned for 2023 in Sarita [externally funded] and 2024 Bedwell).

  1. The results from this study will be important for characterizing the scale of the issue and will be vital for developing restoration prescriptions and can inform indicator development, enhancement, and rebuilding strategies in the region. In particular, for the Bedwell and Sarita Rivers, a rotary screw trap provides a total abundance estimate, which facilities that calculation of the egg-fry survival rate. Developing a relationship between over-winter egg-fry survival and redd scour and sediment movement, will be important for understanding the scale of the issue in watersheds across WVCI and the urgency needed to address this issue.

Infection with this bacterial pathogen can result in significant morbidity and mortality in cultured juvenile Pacific salmon most notably Chinook salmon. The current strategy for disease avoidance is screening brood stock to exclude eggs from highly infected brood females using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a predetermined positive-negative threshold optical density value. The current guidelines for control of BKD have significantly reduced the incidence of disease in both hatchery-reared juveniles and returning adult fish.

The Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP) has 16 years of ELISA data for many Vancouver Island and mainland Coho and Chinook stocks, providing thirteen 3-year cycle for Chinook and fourteen 3-year cycle for Coho salmon. In addition, SEP also has direct fluorescent antibody technique (DFAT) semi-quantitative prevalence pre-release data for many of the stocks with ELISA broodstock data. Epidemiological analysis of this data will provide valuable information for identification of potential explanatory variables for BKD prevalence in stocks of concern. Furthermore, the ELISA database can be linked to the Parental Based Tagging (PBT) database.

The objectives of this project are as follows: \- Analysis of the ELISA data to identify potential explanatory variables and magnitude of effect as hatchery level management measures. \- Use simulation to model effect of increasing the positive-negative culling threshold optical density value \- Analysis of the DFAT prevalence for yearling stocks prior to release to identify potential predictor variables. \- Link PBT data with ELISA data analysis from the first objective.

2025-2026,2401,Epidemiological modeling of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus in Sockeye salmon,PSSI (B-base),Aquatic Animal Health,Kyle Garver,Approved,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a deadly virus of sockeye salmon, causing catastrophic losses during the early lifestages (1-4). Long-term monitoring of IHNV infections across multiple stocks of sockeye salmon has revealed the prevalence of IHNV infections can vary annually within and between stocks; however, the factor(s) responsible for such fluctuations in IHNV prevalence in sockeye salmon stocks in British Columbia remain unresolved. Understanding the drivers behind the occurrence and perpetuation of IHNV in Sockeye salmon is instrumental in managing and mitigating the risk of this endemic pathogen.

Building upon work conducted through the Program for Aquaculture Regulatory Research, we’ll utilize epidemiological analytical approaches to study the patterns of IHNV occurrence across Fraser, Skeena and Columbia River Sockeye salmon stocks with the goal of identifying the factors which influence IHNV infection and disease in BC Sockeye salmon stocks. This will be achieved through three main objectives accomplished over a two year period: Objective 1: (Year 1) – Expand upon a long-term dataset of IHNV in Fraser and Skeena Sockeye stocks to include IHNV monitoring results of Okanagan River Sockeye salmon. In addition this comprehensive IHNV dataset will be populated with data detailing the enumeration of fish at various life stages, survival rates, and productivity for each of the corresponding Sockeye stocks. Where available, data concerning environmental and other potentially important variables gathered from other databases will be integrated into the new database to explore how these variables may impact pathogen prevalence.

2025-2026,2402,Quantifying Yukon Chinook migration mortality and its implications for fisheries management and rebuilding under the Fish Stock Provisions of the Fisheries Act,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,"Brendan Connors, Adam O'Dell, Jaclyn Kendall",Approved,"Yukon River Chinook salmon have experienced declines in returns in recent decades culminating in four of the lowest returns on record in 2020-2023. These declines have put immense strain on the subsistence communities and Fish Nations that historically depended upon Chinook salmon throughout the Yukon River. They have also impacted the ability of the United States and Canada to meet escapement goals under the Pacific Salmon Treaty’s Yukon River Agreement, and are likely to have resulted in the Stock Management Unit, which is scheduled to be prescribed by regulation under the amended Fisheries Act in 2023/2024, to fall below its Limit Reference Point. In recent years large numbers (33%-52%) of returning Canadian-origin Chinook salmon have gone “missing” between sonar assessments at the mouth of the Yukon River and ~2000 km upriver at the border between Alaska and Canada. This has severely undermined the efficacy of fisheries management measures within the Alaskan portion of the river. A leading hypothesis for these missing fish is en route mortality due to heat stress (JTC 2020), which has been documented along with opportunistic observation of premature mortalities in Yukon River Chinook Salmon when spawning migration water temperatures exceed 18°C (Biela et al. 2020; 2022). However, direct estimates of en route mortality do not exist and a recent CSAS regional peer review (DFO 2022) identified the drivers and magnitude of en route mortality, and their consequences for management advice, as a critical uncertainty.

We propose to carry out a 3 year radio-telemetry project to quantify en route mortality of Yukon Chinook in relation to freshwater environmental conditions along their up to ~3000km migration from the mouth of the Yukon river to headwater spawning grounds. We will then use these estimates of en route mortality to evaluate the sustainability of the current aggregate escapement goal for Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook, and rebuilding potential of component Conservation Units (Connors et al. 2022) to inform analyses to meet the Fish Stock Provisions of the revised Fisheries Act for the Stock Management Unit. We are specifically seeking funding to extend radio-tracking infrastructure (towers and aerial overflights) into Canada to take advantage of an Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) project that will tag and track ~600 Chinook salmon in the Alaskan Portion of the Yukon River.

The management question being addressed by this project is: what is the magnitude of en route mortality in Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook and what are its consequences for international and domestic fisheries management, rebuilding potential, and integrated planning.

The specific outcomes of this project include:

  1. estimates of migration speed, timing, and en route mortality of Canadian-origin Yukon Chinook, by Conservation Unit and river section, in relation to freshwater environmental conditions; and

  2. quantitative evaluation of the consequences of a range of en route mortality (based on study) for the sustainability of alternative aggregate escapement goals and rebuilding potential.

2025-2026,2403,San Juan River Adult and Juvenile Assessment Program,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Katie Davidson,Approved,"The San Juan River is major watershed in southwest Vancouver Island (near Port Renfrew, BC) that supports distinct populations of Chinook, Coho and Chum, with Chinook enhanced annually at the 4 Mile Hatchery. The San Juan River empties into Port San Juan (PFMA 20-2).

Pacheedaht First Nation’s Salmon Stewardship Program conducts monitoring and restoration work in the San Juan-Gordon watersheds and estuary. Their work spans the salmon lifecycle and includes investigating impacts of redd scour on egg-to-fry survival, documenting juvenile salmon habitat use in the estuary, and conducting adult spawner surveys. Recently, they have also launched a pilot Chinook marking program with the 4 Mile Hatchery to reduce the impacts of hatchery genetics on the wild Chinook population through selective removals of adipose-clipped Chinook in terminal fisheries.

These activities will all inform the San Juan Chinook Rebuilding Plan in development by PFN, which will be linked to the broader WCVI Chinook Rebuilding Plan in development by DFO (required under the Fish Stock Provisions Act for naturally-produced WCVI Chinook, due March 2024) (DFO 2022; Minister of Justice 2022). However, the recent WCVI Chinook Risk Assessment process identified several knowledge gaps, mostly related to early freshwater and marine life cycle stages. For San Juan Chinook specifically, juvenile data from these life stages (and interactions between hatchery and wild juveniles) are sparse, and biological data on natural spawners (e.g., age, origin) are limited for Chinook.

These reasons make the San Juan River a good candidate to continue developing an integrated life history monitoring program in alignment with the larger Follow The Fish program. We propose to focus on the key work activities identified in Years 1 and 2 of the program, specifically those that complement Pacheedaht’s established juvenile monitoring programs. First, we will continue the rotary screw trap program to enumerate and sample naturally-produced out-migrating juveniles (all species, but focused on juvenile Chinook migration timing), allowing us to compare natural migration timing to hatchery release timing and to gather baseline biological traits relative to hatchery releases (e.g., size, condition). Otolith and stomach samples are also collected from a sub-sample of individuals to assess size-specific survival and diet contents. In Year 2 (2024), we developed a mark-recapture to obtain a relative abundance estimate for naturally-produced juvenile Chinook, and plan to implement this more thoroughly in Year 3 (2025). Second, we will conduct biweekly purse seining in Port San Juan through the late spring, summer and fall months (~May-October) to collect mixed-stock information, including hatchery/natural-origin of juvenile Chinook, stock ID, biological traits, relative abundance, and information on other species schooling with Chinook (e.g., Coho, Pacific Herring). As with the RST program, we will also be collecting otoliths and stomach contents from a sub-sample of Chinook encountered. Finally, we would like to develop a biosampling plan for naturally-spawning Chinook. We currently rely completely on broodstock sampling to assess adult spawner age and origin, but need to collect samples from natural spawners as well to ensure broodstock samples are not introducing any age- or stock-specific biases. This is critical for monitoring the Proportion of Natural Influence (PNI) for San Juan Chinook and to have an accurate representation of age-at-return to assess productivity trends.

We focus on Chinook due to the reasons mentioned previously (e.g., Rebuilding Plans) and for linkages to other programs currently funded under PSSI Pillar 1.1 such as Follow The Fish (DM Apps Project ID 2407), Ecological Indicators (DM Apps Project ID 2414) and Redd Scour Work (DM Apps Project ID 2398). The budget for Year 3 reflects costs for expanding the core field activities from Years 1 and 2, such as longer RST and purse seine seasons based on Year 2 Chinook catch results. Sample processing is also a key focus of Year 3, and the budget reflects the need to process biological samples such as genetics and stomach contents. It also includes technician time to support not only San Juan work but also Ecological Indicators and occasionally Follow The Fish (we plan to share technician resources among all projects as much as possible). Continued technician support is critical in order to meet reporting deadlines for PSSI Pillar 1.1.

By combining these key activities with PFN’s existing programs, we can obtain information from almost all stages of the Chinook life cycle, from adults to eggs to early marine juveniles. PFN employ a team of highly skilled technicians and biologists, and are well placed to eventually lead much of this work in future following this brief period of investment, capacity building, and project development supported by DFO.

2025-2026,2404,"Improving baseline knowledge of environmental conditions in Vancouver Islands fjords through observations and modelling, with a focus on hypoxia dynamics, climate change, and the potential implications for Pacific salmon",PSSI (B-base),Climate Change and Oceans,Laura Bianucci,Approved,"This project supports ongoing observational and modelling work in the fjords of the west coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI), with the goal of better understanding oxygen dynamics in this region. Modelling work started in fiscal year 2021-22 and main deliverables (a coupled physical-biogeochemical model of WCVI, south of Kyuquot) are expected by the end of 2023-24. A small observational component started during 2021-22 and has grown in scope every year. Through PSSI, we have two main goals: to create a monitoring program for Clayoquot Sound in 2023-24 (that will ideally extend to 2025-26) and to support and extend modelling efforts in the WCVI.

Specifically, we propose the following: a. Establish a Clayoquot Sound Monitoring Program in collaboration with the local First Nations (FN) and other organizations (Hakai Institute and Nature Trust of BC). Talks with all involved parties started in 2022-23; the plan is to provide training and equipment to the FN so they can use their vessels to perform monthly conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sampling throughout Clayoquot Sound (45 stations). These observations will support ongoing modelling work and will provide an important baseline of environmental conditions (including oxygen) throughout the year. This baseline is needed to understand the present-day environment experienced by migrating Pacific salmon. Without this baseline, it will be difficult to assess the effects of climate change in salmon populations and migrating routes.

b. Hire a term PC3 to contribute to the progress of the coupled physical-biogeochemical model for the west coast of Vancouver Island. In particular, this PC3 will lead the simulation of future scenarios and will act as a liaison with salmon experts, to ensure that the outputs of our simulations are useful for population distribution modelling and other salmon-related projections.

c. Hire a term EG4 to contribute towards DFO-led fieldwork in the WCVI inlets as well as data processing and management. For instance, technical support is needed for the development/improvement of weather stations and the maintenance of the weather station network (their data are crucial for forcing the surface of coastal ocean models), as well as for support with mooring deployment/servicing and opportunistic CTD sampling (e.g., while servicing weather stations). Furthermore, the EG4 will be needed to manage the inflow of data from the Clayoquot Sound Monitoring Program.

Management questions: Near-surface hypoxia (as shallow as 12 m) has been recently identified in Herbert Inlet, Clayoquot Sound (Rosen et al., 2022, doi:10.3389/fmars.2022.1000041). The historical record in the region is sparse, but it suggests that shallow hypoxia is found occasionally in this inlet. Are salmon runs affected by low-oxygen conditions near the surface in the fjords? Do these shallow hypoxic events constrain/restrict salmon habitat during their migration? Are these shallow hypoxic events increasing in frequency or can they be predicted in any way? (e.g., more common during marine heat waves or during positive/negative ENSO years, etc.). In order to address these questions, as well as the more generic question “What is the environment that salmon encounter during their migration into and out of the rivers, i.e. while they swim through fjords?”, we need to establish a monitoring program throughout the fjords of interest. A consistent sampling program in the next few years will create the baseline from which we will be able to assess future changes; and a monitoring program that continues in the future will make sure we can identify any climate-related change in the fjords’ environment. Furthermore, by combining observations and high-resolution (tens of meters) ocean models, we will be able to understand the mechanisms that drive oxygen (and other – e.g., acidification) conditions in the inlets, and predict how these will be impacted by a changing climate. The modelling work proposed here for the WCVI will allow for the first study of the impacts of future conditions in these fjords.

Risks: The PC3 hired to contribute to the modelling work found permanent employment outside of DFO in July 2024 - it was partly mitigated for the rest of the fiscal by hiring a casual employee (Mike Foreman, retired SE-RES-5 with extensive FVCOM and WCVI experience).

2025-2026,2405,Biological models to support prioritizing salmon stocks under future climates,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Modelling & Decision Support,"Brendan Connors, Cameron Freshwater, Patrick Thompson",Approved,"There is widespread recognition that Pacific salmon populations will be heavily impacted by climate change. These impacts are, however, expected to vary in space and time as well as across species and life stages. As a result, quantifying stock-specific risks of environmental change is critical for prioritizing DFO management actions. We propose to develop a data-driven analytical framework to quantify functional responses to climate variables across the salmon life cycle and make projections for how stocks will respond to climate change. Our approach will be sufficiently flexible to incorporate information from stocks that span a broad range of data quality.

Our multi-year proposal involves two components: In component 1, we will pair existing data on Pacific salmon population dynamics with readily available freshwater and marine environmental data to estimate the effect of variables such as temperature, flow, and food availability on salmon productivity (e.g. recruits per spawner). We will quantify life stage-specific effects on survival for stocks, including those with estimates of both juvenile and adult abundance. The focal stocks for initial modeling of data-rich stocks will be determined in year 1, with the goal of including stocks representing different species, geographic areas and status assessments relative to Wild Salmon Policy benchmarks. Ultimately, we will develop a hierarchical modeling framework which will allow us to leverage relationships in data-rich systems to estimate effects on data-limited stocks. In component 2, we will couple this modelling framework with downscaled climate models to project stock-specific responses under future climate scenarios. The projected biological status of different stocks, and associated uncertainty in them, will provide a scientifically defensible foundation upon which management interventions can be prioritized.

We are requesting funds to hire two term Research Scientists to develop the modelling framework. We expect that if only one RES were funded (or one RES and a BI2) that they could develop an initial model and demonstrate its application to a small number of case studies. However, to achieve the goal of developing a data-driven framework that is ready to be applied to stocks throughout the Pacific region, including those with medium or low data availability, two RES positions are necessary. Although the two researchers would work collaboratively, one position is focused on fitting models to estimate functional relationships for data-rich stock while the other will use simulations to develop methods for leveraging information from data-rich stocks to data-poor and provide decision criteria for broader implementation.

Such a change is thought to have occurred in Puget Sound, with negative effects on the early marine survival of juvenile salmon. The proposed collaboration, involving a geochemical oceanographer (SJ) and biological oceanographers from Canada (AS) and the United States (CK), will permit a multidisciplinary approach to the research question. The project leverages existing samples, data and monitoring programs. It combines data from new and existing sediment and seawater samples with a trend analysis of archived taxonomic data. It will expand the geographic and temporal overage of existing data, while adding new biomarker analysis (sterols and fatty acids). It is crucial for managers to understand the causes of trends and variability in salmon populations in order to set catch limits. This project will determine whether a change in primary productivity (“carrying capacity”) could be responsible for observed long-term declines in some species of salmon.

2025-2026,2407,Follow the Fish: An integrated Chinook salmon assessment and monitoring program for the West Coast of Vancouver Island,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Jessy Bokvist,Approved,"Follow the Fish (FtF), is an overarching research program being developed to provide urgently needed information for effective conservation and rebuilding of West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook salmon populations. WCVI Chinook are listed under bill C-68 and are threatened by local extinction and poor marine survival, with high mortality thought to occur during the early marine phase. Through the recent multi-stakeholder WCVI Chinook Salmon Marine Risk Assessment (MRA) process multiple data gaps were identified for potential factors that contribute to poor early marine survival. Many salmon surveys have been conducted over the years, but few have been able to access shallower areas within the sounds off the West Coast, where ocean-type Chinook may reside for up to their first year at sea. Characterizing environmental variables of these nearshore ecosystems in addition to the health and condition of residing Chinook salmon is critical to understanding which factors may be limiting survival. To address data gaps, in 2020 a highly collaborative assessment program in nearshore areas within Sounds on the WCVI was piloted to capture juvenile Chinook salmon in their first winter at sea using microtrolling technology. Building on the successful implementation and collaboration in this program, FtF aims to expand the assessment and monitoring of WCVI Chinook both spatially and temporally to track fish throughout their first year of life and identify limiting factors related to growth and size-specific survival. The FtF program will focus on assessing Chinook salmon originating from Stamp River, Sarita River and Nitinat River populations in Barkley Sound as indicators of WCVI Chinook. Stamp River is an existing indicator for WCVI Chinook, and existing programs and infrastructure can enable relatively high rates of juvenile captures across the early marine phase. Previous microtrolling efforts have demonstrated these populations are detected in nearshore areas throughout WCVI Sounds over the winter through capture of hatchery and wild fish. Although these populations are predominately hatchery origin fish, contrasts will be made, where possible, between wild and hatchery fish to understand how factors limiting survival and growth may differ. Salmon will be captured at multiple time points throughout their life cycle including in the Nitinat River Hatchery and Robertson Creek Hatchery, in-river (rotary screw trap and/or beach seining), in estuary (beach seining/purse seining), and in nearshore marine environments (purse seining/microtrolling). At each time point, individual fish will be sampled to assess health and condition (infectious agents, Fit-Chip gene expression profiles, stomach contents, contaminants, lengths, weights, and clinical signs) and stock of origin, paired with environmental data including physical oceanography (temperature, oxygen, pH salinity, fluorescence) and biological oceanography (chlorophyl, zooplankton). Scale samples from individual fish will be used to compare relative rates of growth, based on circulus spacing, across life stages and populations to assess the impact of health, condition and environmental factors. Otolith samples taken concurrently will be used to assess relative size-specific survival across time points and populations. This can be achieved by characterizing the fork length to otolith radius relationship for smolts at ocean entry and then using otolith microchemistry for individuals who survive to subsequent time points. Broad distributional trends in how WCVI Chinook migrate will be investigated with microtrolling by capturing Northward migrating Barkley origin fish in Clayoquot, Nootka, Kyuquot and Quatsino Sound. Chinook intercepted during microtrolling that are not of Sarita, Stamp or Nitinat origin will be similarly sampled for comparisons. Many current departmental research programs are collecting datasets on salmon populations and their ecosystems that can be incorporated into the FtF program for a comprehensive assessment of factors limiting survival of WCVI Chinook. FtF is in discussion and working alongside both internal and external collaborators to ensure datasets are integrated into FtF (see project linkages). Existing DFO datasets from researchers across branches will be synthesized alongside relevant datasets produced by external collaborators. Throughout our FtF project timeline, we aim to incorporate relevant datasets through new collaborations and outreach. This approach will highlight data gaps that are not currently being addressed through either departmental or external research groups and future research avenues. Data outputs from this program will directly contribute to the WCVI Chinook rebuilding plans and will be distributed across to project collaborators for use in their programs. Knowledge on differential size-specific survival both across the early marine phase and between wild and hatchery stocks will have impacts on SEP management decisions for hatcheries and may inform harvest strategies for WCVI Chinook populations. Characterizing differential growth across the early marine phase will have important implications for restoration activities (e.g., limited prey availability) and stock management e.g., (mitigating impacts on periods and areas of critical growth). Overall, data outputs can be incorporated into pre-season and in-season forecasting and other WCVI Chinook models.

With the continual depletion of funds available for salmon health research in both SEP and Science Branch, diagnostic capacity of the finfish diagnostic laboratory (FDL) at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) has not kept pace with new technologies, and there is limited technology transfer between Science Branch and SEP. The anticipated outcomes of this project are to re-establish the linkage between SEP and the Science Branch and to use the expertise of the Science Branch to improve, expand, and modernize the FDL. In doing so, this will provide SEP with the information necessary to provide long-term support for the enhanced capacity of the FDL. This multi-year project will result in a proactive approach to optimizing salmonid hatchery health management and will be accomplished through the completion of the following objectives.

Optimization and validation of non-lethal screening methods for detection of *Renibacterium salmoninarum* in Chinook Salmon broodstock.** Development of a protocol for non-lethal detection of *Renibacterium salmoninarum* in broodstock was initiated in Year 2. For this work, non-lethal samples (anal fin, gill clip, mucus, and anal swab) as well as kidney were collected from Chinook salmon broodstock in Fall 2024. Samples are currently being screened by qPCR and ELISA (kidney only) with results expected by the end of this fiscal year. In Year 3, we will analyze these results to determine assay agreement and which non-lethal sample is most appropriate. 

Assay validation, including determination of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, will be completed in Year 3. To do so, samples will be collected from apparently healthy salmon held in the Brett Aquarium at PBS, spiked with *R. salmoninarum* nucleic acid, and diagnostic specificity and sensitivity determined. In Fall 2025, we will screen broodstock samples from multiple stocks at three to four facilities and compare molecular and ELISA results. 

If the non-lethal samples lack sensitivity as compared to ELISA (the gold standard), then a meeting will be held with SEP managers to determine the needs of the organization with regards to non-lethal sampling (diagnostic thresholds, invasiveness, etc.) and potential avenues for further research. 

The results of this work will be provided to SEP in the form of a report as well as a presentation if desired.

**Objective 2. Continued longitudinal surveillance of select stocks.** Targeted screening of healthy and diseased fish from SEP hatcheries and/or spawning channels will continue in Year 3. Pathogens of interest include *Flavobacterium columnare*, *Ichthyophthirius multifiliis*, *Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae*, *R. salmoninarum*, and *F. psychrophilum*. The majority of the testing effort will focus on the latter two as these are enzootic bacteria that have a significant negative impact on salmonid health. At the end of Year 3, an internal report on pathogen distribution, prevalence, and infection level will be prepared for distribution to SEP. Additionally, as all samples being screened for *R. salmoninarum* by our qPCR assay are also being screened by ELISA, a preliminary estimate of assay agreement will be prepared. 

**Objective 3. Implementation of next generation sequencing pipelines for identification of unknown microorganisms.** 
Samples (whole fish, tissue, or ovarian fluid) submitted to FDL are screened for pathogens using traditional diagnostic techniques (histology and bacterial/viral culture) or molecular assays. However, it is not uncommon to re-isolate microorganisms that cannot be identified using standard methodologies. In Year 3, we will use Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), a next generation sequencing (NGS) platform, to identify archived unknown agents of interest. For bacterial agents, the raw 16S ribosomal DNA sequences obtained from the Nanopore platform will be analyzed by the wf-16s pipeline in the EPI2ME program curated by ONT. For viral agents, the Virology Program at AAH has developed a pipeline for analysis and identification of agents. 

As noted in Objective 2, we have been routinely surveilling spawning broodstock for *F. psychrophilum*. We have re-isolated yellow-pigmented bacterial (YPB) from these fish on numerous occasions. Although morphologically similar to *F. psychrophilum*, a validated qPCR assay for *F. psychrophilum* has confirmed these isolates are not *F. psychrophilum*. These isolates are of particular interest as YPB have been recognized as possible emergent fish pathogens in salmonids. YPB isolated from salmonids in both California and the Laurentian Great Lakes have been identified as members of the *Chryseobacterium* genus of which there are several species that have been shown to cause disease in experimentally infected salmonids. In using NGS technologies to identify our YPB isolates, we will determine if *Chryseobacterium* spp. are present in enhanced salmon in British Columba.

2025-2026,2409,Convergent tracks: a tagging study to quantify salmon predation by sea lions,PSSI (B-base),Pinnipeds,"Strahan Tucker, Cameron Freshwater",Approved,"The abundance of many Pacific salmon populations has remained below management reference points for decades despite large reductions in exploitation rates. A common paradigm is that poor marine survival has constrained recovery; however, the mechanisms (e.g. predation vs. starvation) leading to mortality and at which life stages they operate remain unclear. One specific hypothesis is that large aggregations of Steller sea lions intercept Fraser River sockeye salmon (10 of 24 CUs threatened or endangered (COSEWIC 2017)) north of Vancouver Island during return migrations. Yet little is known about sea lion foraging behaviour and diet in these remote transitions zones between offshore and coastal areas and even less is known about salmon mortality rates. Our proposal outlines a field program to addresses salmon and pinniped components simultaneously. This work will employ leading edge technologies to generate hard data on sources of salmon mortality and specifically the degree of pinniped mortality, moving us/debate/issue beyond the realm of conjecture and inference. Although this document describes a sockeye salmon-sea lion field program, we emphasize that our proposal is modular in that one or both species components can be pursued, and the framework could focus on alternative pinniped species, salmon species or salmon life stages based on departmental priorities (e.g. harbor seal impacts on juvenile Chinook salmon); however the costs associated with tagging juvenile salmonids will be considerably higher.

We will estimate sea lion predation on adult sockeye salmon as they migrate past Triangle Island, off the northern tip of Vancouver Island. This region is the site of the largest Steller sea lion rookery in the world and is hypothesized to be a survival bottleneck that disproportionately impacts Fraser River sockeye salmon productivity (e.g. Walters et al. 2020). Salmon-related work would quantify predation impacts via multiple complementary tagging technologies. After capturing sockeye salmon via purse seine near Haida Gwaii, we will use satellite tags to quantify guild-specific predation rates (e.g. cetacean, pinniped, shark) based on depth and temperature sensors, to generate high resolution estimates of salmon habitat use, and to estimate diversion rates that may moderate predation impacts (i.e. migrations through Juan de Fuca rather than Johnstone Strait). We will leverage existing acoustic telemetry infrastructure in the northern Strait of Georgia, that will increase the precision of mortality rate estimates at relatively low cost. Pinniped-related work will include complementary methods (fatty acids, stable isotopes and scats) to estimate diets at multiple temporal scales along migration pathways on either side of Vancouver Island. Pinniped diet analyses will be complemented by satellite tagging to understand movements, distribution and foraging behaviour in relation to salmon mortality locations. We wish to emphasize that these pinniped data will be highly relevant for gauging predator impacts more broadly, Including other PSSI initiatives.

For the salmon component, Y1 (FY 2023-24) will be a ramp-up period, with tagging occurring in Y2 and Y3. For the pinniped component, diet collections will begin in Y1 and continue through Y3. We will undertake initial satellite tagging of pinnipeds in Y1 to refine effective protocols and increase tagging rates in Y2 and Y3. Analytical pipelines for both components will be developed in Y2 so that final analyses can begin in Y3 and continue through 2026 (PIs have the capacity to complete analytical work without additional staffing). Unfortunately salmon tagging will occur during off cycle years; however we anticipate sufficient numbers of fish will be available to meet our sample size requirements.

Ultimately data on survival rates and predation are critical to several management questions. First, total survival rates can provide strategic information on whether specific life history stages are likely to constrain recovery (i.e. if survival is high then subsequent efforts should focus on other stages). Second, information on guild-specific predation rates can provide information on the utility of targeted management actions (e.g. fisheries, culls). These data are also key inputs to ongoing life cycle and ecosystem modeling efforts intended to guide prioritization of Pacific salmon stocks for rebuilding.

2025-2026,2410,Improved decision making for salmon by understanding the threats of freshwater Aquatic Invasive Species both now and in the future,PSSI (B-base),Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS),"Thomas Therriault, Cher LaCoste",Approved,"Climate change and Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) are leading threats to biodiversity globally. In British Columbia (BC), many salmon stocks have been assessed as at-risk by COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada), but while climate change has been increasingly considered in salmon management and policy, the threat posed by AIS has largely been ignored. Further, stressors like increasing global temperatures are out of the control of regional management while AIS can be managed locally. By targeting AIS most likely to have the biggest impact on salmon survival or productivity, we can improve salmon recovery by reducing the stress that these invasive species cause. AIS impacts on salmon are well documented in the US Pacific Northwest where, for example, invasive Walleye consume up to 2 million smolts a year in the Columbia River (Sanderson et al. 2009). The expansion of Northern Pike in Alaska has led to the decline of salmon productivity in some regions and all five salmon species have been classified as highly vulnerable to pike invasion in at least part of their Alaskan range (Jalbert et al. 2021). Habitat alteration can also impact salmon: Schwoerer et al. (2019) estimated the potential for $159 million annual damage to the Alaskan Sockeye salmon industry from one invasive plant species, Elodea. However, the extent and relative impact of freshwater AIS threats to salmon habitat and productivity have yet to be assessed in BC. Here we will fill this gap.

In some American reaches of the Columbia River there have been over 30 AIS recorded (Sanderson et al. 2009). Further, there are over 1300 AIS in pathways that have the potential to be introduced to BC, many of which threaten salmon.

2025-2026,2412,"Investigation of the impacts of singular and coinciding acute climate stressors on the nutritional quality of the pteropod Limacina helicina, a juvenile Pacific salmon dietary species",PSSI (B-base),Climate Change and Oceans,"Ian Forster, Cher LaCoste, Chris Pearce, Clara Mackenzie",Approved,"In recent years, the Northeast Pacific has experienced regular heatwaves and upwelling events (i.e. movement of waters, often acidified, from depth to coastal shallows). These acute stressor events are predicted to increase in both duration and frequency due to climate change (Frölicher et al., 2018). The proposed project will examine the impacts of warming and upwelling events (with acidified water) on the nutritional status of Limacina helicina, a cold-water pteropod that serves as an important dietary item for juvenile Pacific salmon species in the Northern Pacific (Brodeur et al., 2007; Doubleday & Hopcroft, 2015; Sturdevant et al., 2012). For example, dietary analyses of juvenile pink salmon and sockeye salmon within the Gulf of Alaska have shown a predominance of L. helicina (Brodeur et al., 2007; Doubleday & Hopcroft, 2015; Sturdevant et al., 2012). Research has demonstrated that shell development, growth, and survival of L. helicina are all highly susceptible to warming and ocean acidification (Manno et al., 2017), but there has been limited investigation of impacts to pteropod nutritional quality (i.e. composition) under the context of acute stressor events. Prey nutritional quality is a key aspect of feeding ecology that directly contributes to the survival of higher trophic species (Ahlgren et al., 2005; Daly et al., 2010). In salmon, variation in invertebrate prey quantity and quality may influence growth and survival, especially during early marine residence (Litz et al., 2019). Altered dietary lipid levels, for example, have been linked to changes in fish growth, fat deposition, and digestive enzyme activity (Pelusio et al., 2021). Consequently, we propose that any change in the nutritive status of L. helicina under climate stressor conditions could have carry-over impacts to juvenile salmon growth, health, and survival.

2025-2026,2415,A Decision Support Framework for Identifying and Characterizing the Non-fishing Threats to Pacific Salmon,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Modelling & Decision Support,"Thomas Therriault, Cher LaCoste",Submitted,"There is little doubt that commercial, recreational, and FSC fisheries have contributed to the decline of several Pacific salmon stocks in British Columbia (BC). However, there are a multitude of non-fishing threats facing BC salmon that have not been fully identified nor characterized including Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS), harmful algal blooms (HABs), disease and pathogens, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals, etc. Further, many of these stressors can interact such that the cumulative effect of these stressors is likely greater than the sum of individual stressors. However, these stressors are unlikely evenly distributed across the Pacific such that different stocks will face different stressors and may respond differently. Thus, spatial and stock considerations will be critical. Finally, these stressors are affecting BC salmon at different life history stages across the freshwater, estuarine, and marine systems they utilize to complete their life cycle with climate change exacerbating the problem. By developing a decision support framework it will be possible to identify and characterize the individual and multiple stressors affecting salmon productivity or recovery in a standardized way among Pacific salmon stocks. This will allow managers to better incorporate and mitigate these non-fishing stressors most impacting salmon in decision making. Not only will this conveying a more complete understanding of stock status and threats to industry, stakeholders, and First Nations it will facilitate the inclusion of this information in fisheries management plans and SARA recovery plans. Further, this approach will allow targeting limited resources to those stressors that can best be managed with a clearer understanding of how salmon may be expected to respond when these threats are mitigated.  
Based on the non-fishing threats identified in the previous year, along with their expected impacts on BC salmon stocks, we will develop a geospatial dataset of these threats that can then be attributed to individual stocks. By developing an interaction matrix it will be possible to specify the stock-specific threats facing BC salmon and clearly indicate which management decision making processes need to include this information (e.g., fishing plan, recovery plan).

At the Nov 2022 workshop our breakout group identified a number of known stressors and in some cases we were able to identify specific threats to salmon. However, we had a much longer list of potential stressors for which we did not have subject matter experts. Thus, the first step will be to hire a dedicated BI-02 who will undertake a literature review, including Fisheries Management Plans, CSAS Advisory Documents, SARA Recovery Potential Assessments and Recovery Plans, to identify a range of non-fishing stressors affecting salmon and how DFO currently considers/doesn’t consider them in decision making. The second step will be to talk to subject matter experts both withing and outside DFO to fill information gaps that are identified during the initial review. This preliminary list will then be used in the third step, targeted workshops, where the experts will work to identify the causal mechanisms behind these stressors (e.g., life history stage affected, type of impact, duration, intensity, magnitude, recovery, etc.) and how they can be better considered in DFO decision making. This dual approach of literature review and expert opinions has been used previously to identify stressors impacting kelp recovery in the Salish Sea (Hollarsmith et al. 2022).

Based on the results of the first two years of the project, the third year will specifically develop decision support tools that will aid managers in how best to incorporate non-fishing threats across an array of DFO management and policy decision making processes, including, but not limited to Fisheries Management, SARA recovery planning, SEP restoration activities, and FFHPP integrated planning processes. Further, by developing this in conjunction with First Nations, it will expand on existing DFO’s efforts on Reconciliation.

Regular monitoring of harmful algal biotoxins in BC coastal waters since 2020 (Ross and Mueller, 2024) has revealed significant correlations between climate variables (e.g. water temperature) and the concentrations of these toxins in areas known to be frequented by Pacific salmon, including WCVI Chinook for which harmful algae have been identified as a high future risk (PSSI Risk Assessment Workshop #3). The goal of this project is to build upon our Biotoxin Monitoring Program (DFO Fieldnote OSDOEB_10) by adapting established analytical methods and procedures to measure harmful algal biotoxins in Pacific salmon, their prey and habitat. This information will be combined with environmental and taxonomic (plankton) data, and assessments of the health and condition of sampled fish, to help predict the effects of climate change and related processes on the exposure of Pacific salmon to these toxins, and potential impacts on their health and survival.

2025-2026,2417,Optimization of feeds used in the hatchery production of Pacific Salmon.,PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,"Ian Forster, Cher LaCoste, Erika Eliason",Approved,"To date, much of the recent research on salmonid diets and formulation of nutritionally complete commercial feeds has focused on rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon (NRC 2011, Hardy and Kaushik 2021). These feeds are not formulated for Pacific salmon, which require a specific balance of nutrients and other diet constituents to assure egg and juvenile quality, parr-smolt transformation and subsequent performance in seawater (Hanson et al. 2016, Perry et al. 2006, Jutfelt et al. 2007), as well as to limit the stress response following seawater introduction (Herrera et al. 2019). To this end, we propose to formulate and test new diets specific for the production of Pacific salmon, especially Chinook and coho, optimized to SEP hatcheries.

The data collected in Year 1 will help us to select diets for use in feeding trials to be conducted at SEP facilities rearing Coho and Chinook salmon in Years 2 and 3. Collectively, these data will support the future formulation of improved diets for Pacific salmon.

Feeding trials will be conducted at SEP hatcheries in Years 2 and 3 on juvenile ocean-type Chinook and Coho salmon. The diets to be compared will be selected based upon the results of Year 1 and agreed upon by the research team and SEP staff. Dr. Forster, the project lead, has extensive experience in conducting and peer-review publishing comparative feeding trials in salmon. Other team members have extensive experience in the assessment of physiological, immunological and health status of salmon.

Ultimately, this project will provide science-based advice to SEP facilities on the use of supplemented or specially formulated diets to better meet the needs of Pacific salmon and specifically address management concerns as to whether current industry-formulated feeds administered to juvenile ocean-type Chinook and Coho are sufficiently optimized.

2025-2026,2418,Prediction of reproductive success of Chinook salmon based on Thiamine concentrations in returning adults.,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,"Ian Forster, Cher LaCoste, Erika Eliason",Approved,"What is being proposed: Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency complex (TDC) is an emerging issue of concern for Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, in the North Pacific. Thiamine is an essential vitamin for all organisms, that is derived from their diet. Deficiency is most overtly expressed in salmonids as early mortality of fry, but secondary effects impact all life stages. TDC was first observed in the North Pacific in 2014 when up to 70% of Chinook from the Yukon River, a system which has experienced declines in Chinook productivity, were found to have limiting levels of egg thiamine (Larson and Howard 2019; Honeyfield et al. 2016). In 2020, TDC was diagnosed for the first time in California Chinook and found responsible for excessive fry mortality. Despite its presence both north and south of BC, to date, only a single study has measured thiamine levels in BC salmon and this included just two Chinook (Welch et al. 2018). TDC may already be an important driver of BC Chinook salmon population declines, and is expected to be an increasingly important issue as oceans warm and prey communities change. Significantly, when TDC is diagnosed there are effective treatment strategies to mitigate the effects which can be applied in hatcheries to limit fry mortality. Assessment and monitoring, of Thiamine deficiency can be used by SEP and StAD to inform planning decisions for stocks where expectations of reduced spawning performance may be expected, e.g., SEP could use this information to focus egg collection efforts, or remediation actions such as Thiamine injection / baths, on stocks that may be at greater risk of low spawning success. StAD could use this information to improve their assessment of the current status and health of salmon stocks.

2025-2026,2421,Measurement of stress hormones in scales and its application for the identification of conditions causing chronic stress in Pacific Salmon.,PSSI (B-base),Biotechnology and Genomics,Stewart Johnson,Approved,"Exposure of fish to stressors can elicit physiological changes at multiple levels of animal organization, these alterations are collectively known as the stress response. The hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis which is activated in response to most forms of stress in fish, initiates and regulates the stress response. In fish cortisol is the predominant glucocorticoid released as part of the primary stress response, and is critical for mediating adaptive metabolic, physiological, and behavioral adjustments. However, prolonged elevation of cortisol, due to extended or repeated exposure to stressors, can negatively affect fish behavior, growth, reproduction and immune functions (reviewed in Schreck and Tort, 2016).

The analysis of circulating (serum/plasma) cortisol is the most common method used in stress response assessments in fish. This method works well under controlled situations, where fish can be caught and rapidly sampled (within minutes to avoid the rapid increase in cortisol which occurs in response to capture stress) and it provides information on the acute stress response at the time of collection (immediate state of stress). However, to understand chronic stress the past cortisol history of individuals needs to be understood. Fish scales have been recently recognized as a biomaterial that accumulates cortisol, and other physiologically important hormones including cortisone, over long periods of time. Moreover, scale cortisol levels are not affected by stress associated with capture (reviewed in Laberge et al. 2019; Kennedy and Janz, 2023).

Cortisol is released from the interrenals in fish as a biologically active steroid hormone. At the tissue level, the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11βhsd2) converts cortisol into its biologically inactive metabolite, cortisone. Importantly, this step is irreversible in fish, highlighting the importance of 11βhsd2 in the regulation of cortisol levels in teleosts (Tsachaki et al. 2017). Since 11βhsd2 is present in fish skin, assessing the expression of this enzyme in the skin during chronic stress, and measuring both cortisol and cortisone content will provide critical context for scale cortisol deposition and clearance, and further validate the use of scales as an indicator of chronic stress in fish.

We are proposing the use of levels of stress hormones (cortisol, cortisone) in scales as a tool for routine monitoring of chronic stress in different life history stages of Pacific salmon. As an example, this tool could be used to examine individual and population effects of external stressors encountered during migration on cortisol dynamics, which has implications with respect to population resilience to stressors such as climate change. The use of scales is minimally invasive and therefore suitable for use in populations of conservation concern. However, to interpret values obtained from scales we first need to understand the temporal profile of stress hormone accumulation and rates of clearance in scales under different environmental conditions for the different species of Pacific Salmon.

In this project we will conduct laboratory and hatchery-based studies to determine/optimize: 1) sampling methods (e.g. study spatial heterogeneity of scale stress hormone content (SSHC)), 2) effects of acute vs. chronic stress on SSHC, 3) relationship between plasma and SSHC, 4) individual, stock and temporal variability in SSHC, including changes associated with smoltification, and 5) effects of unpredictable chronic stress on plasma and SSHC. We will use, and modify, if necessary, analytical methods for SSHC that have been used in studies of goldfish and rainbow trout (Laberge et al. 2019; Kennedy and Janz, 2023).

2025-2026,2423,Complementing British Columbia’s coasts longest Sea Surface Temperature and Salinity records with 21st century technology to monitor a changing climate.,PSSI (B-base),Climate Change and Oceans,Jennifer Jackson,Approved,"At present, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data are collected as part of DFO’s British Columbia Shore Station Program (BCSOP) at twelve coastal stations that have been monitored for several decades, the earliest commencing in 1914 (see map below).

The data are collected manually, by lighthouses keepers, at a daily interval. Despite its success in providing data at remote locations for an outstanding duration (one of the longest in the world of this kind), the program faces challenges and limitations: gaps due to weather conditions, concerns with lighthouse keepers payment, time lag between data collection and reception and relatively coarse observational resolution. Theses challenges result in gaps in the timeseries which can limit their otherwise wide range of possible applications.

To address those challenges and enhance these valuable timeseries, we propose the testing and deployment of autonomous systems which can record SST and SSS at higher frequency (e.g. hourly) and transmit those data in near real-time. The system would consist of an in-situ sensors package, a data logger and transmitter and an antenna. Examples of such systems include elements of the Ocean Network Canada (https://data.oceannetworks.ca/home) and of Smart Atlantic, on the East coast (https://www.smartatlantic.ca/station_alt.html?id=dfo_nharb).

The main outcome of this project will be the acquisitions of continuous, gap-free, high resolution (hourly) timeseries of SST and SSS at key sites along the BC coast. These timeseries would be available in real-time mode and/or delay mode and posted online via the Open Data portal (https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/719955f2-bf8e-44f7-bc26-6bd623e82884) as well as on the Ocean Network Canada and Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS, https://cioos.ca/about/). The number of sites to be equipped upon successful testing (1st year) will depend on budget available (details below); a minimum of 4 stations would be necessary to be representative of the BC coast as a whole, i.e. Salish Sea (Chrome Island to Race Rocks), West coast (Amphitrite Point to Kains Island), North coast (Pine Island to Bonilla Island) and Haida Gwaii (Langara Island). Region and station priorities would be defined upon results of the first year tests and in coordination with other researchers and PSSI priorities.

SST and SSS characteristics determine the suitability of marine ecosystems habitat for native and invasive species that impacts migration patterns, predator-prey relationships and stock abundance. Data from the BCSOP currently contributes to fisheries management as input into forecasts of the northern diversion of Fraser River sockeye and models of salmon and anchovy stock abundance in the Strait of Georgia. Thus, enhanced data from this initiative would not only strengthen the current applications but also be helpful to newly implemented PSSI initiatives.

2025-2026,2424,Mechanistic modelling to link hydrology to juvenile salmon habitat quality and productivity,PSSI (B-base),Freshwater Habitat Research,Sean Naman,Approved,"Hydrology is a key determinant of salmon productivity and persistence in freshwater and is rapidly changing in many areas from human activities and climate warming. Yet, it remains challenging to make explicit predictions about how hydrology influences salmon. We aim to advance a mechanistic and tractable modelling framework that links hydrology (flow and temperature) to local-scale habitat availability and productivity potential of stream-rearing juvenile salmon. The proposed approach integrates well-established theory of geomorphology and fish energetics to predict how juvenile salmon rearing habitat availability and productivity potential is influenced by dynamic flow and temperature regimes (Fig. 1). The approach aims to be accessible by using a tractable set of inputs that would emerge from typical field habitat monitoring and is applicable across different systems and salmonid species. We propose rolling out this modelling framework as part of a larger watershed-scale research program in the North Thompson, where we have established an extensive field monitoring network of flow, temperature, and habitat conditions that would be direct model inputs. Ongoing intensive monitoring of juvenile coho populations and physiological condition (D. Patterson proposal) in these systems will inform model validation. For example, modelled predictions could be directly compared to measures of coho abundance, production, or physiological condition.

We anticipate 3 main outcomes from the work: (1) a modelling framework and interface (e.g., R Shiny App); (2) predictions of how juvenile coho rearing habitat availability and productivity potential responds to diverse flow and temperature regimes across tributaries of the North Thompson; and (3) advice to internal and external clients for setting environmental flow guidelines under dynamic hydrologic conditions. For example, the work will directly plug into ongoing engagement with the Thompson-Shuswap Environmental Flows Committee, which is actively developing flow management guidelines and drought response thresholds for the region. Further, the modelling framework will provide a platform to explore the potential consequences of climate and land use impacts on flows and temperatures, e.g., based on broader-scale, climate averaged temperature and flow projections under climate change (J. Iacarella proposal). This would provide a powerful, yet computationally simple and accessible way to explore and communicate the dynamic relationships between flows and salmon in a warming world. Overall, the approach is easily extendable to other systems and salmonid species, thus could become a widely used tool across the Province.

Approaches to predict biological responses to flow are integral to numerous management issues. We envision the modelling framework informing regulatory decision-making by FFHPP related to flow alterations (e.g., hydro operations or water withdrawals), as well as land use and restoration planning. Our work fills a gap for these applications given that existing instream flow modelling tends to either be static and descriptive and thus not applicable to dynamic conditions, or have prohibitively steep information and computational requirements. This is a 3-year project that would support two parallel elements: (1) collection of habitat, flow, and temperature data in coho rearing tributaries across the North Thompson; and (2) development of model structure and interface. Manuscript and report preparation and client engagement will occur primarily in years 2 and 3.

The goal of the project is to transport and release smolts past the seal haul out and then compare marine survival rates between transported smolts and those out-migrating naturally. The pilot project began with a low number of smolts transported in small trial releases to test the effect of additional handling/ osmoregulation on fish as well as the function of equipment. Small numbers of fish were PIT tagged to confirm fish are able to recover from the procedure and be transported on the same day. Additional activities included continuation of harbour seal counts (Figure 2) on local haul outs during the smolt (May) and adult (July) peak migration windows. Transport activities are conducted with shíshálh Nation’s newly acquired 30 foot aluminum landing craft which is suited to this kind of work.

In years 2-5 (spring 2023-2026), we propose scaling up releases to achieve adequate sample sizes in order to properly test the hypothesis. A minimum of 1,000 and up to 2,500 PIT tagged sockeye are recommended per year such that a 1% survival will yield a total of 10-25 tag returns. Return rates of less than 1% may be too low to justify operationalizing this activity long term. The transport of non-tagged fish should be avoided as to not confound comparisons with the control group (untagged fence migrants). Results from 2023/24 releases will be realized in 2025/26 escapement years at which point a decision on the future of the project can be made. Additional activities may include walking the Hodson Island haul out with a mobile PIT tag antenna to look for evidence of predation on out migrating smolts (river or transport groups; Coho and Sockeye), or installing a PIT antenna on the haul out.

Sakinaw Sockeye has been confirmed as an endangered stock since 2003, and a recovery potential assessment, completed in 2017 cited low marine survival as the greatest limiting factor in recovery, with predator abundance and assumed predation on smolts and adults ranked as high risk, with a critical level of impact. Perpetually low marine survivals are preventing recovery such that the persistence of the population is entirely dependent on a captive brood program. This activity may be one of the few tools available to increase survival.

Increased frequency, particularly in the spring and fall will allow better resolution of physical processes and on match-mismatch between juvenile salmon and they prey in the Strait. Further, increased sampling frequency will improve resolution of physical measurements which benefit both statistical power and model prediction. The project expands upon the current monthly SoG plankton survey program (22 stations) to include additional biweekly surveys starting mid-February through to mid-April and then again late August through end of September. These additional surveys would target a key subset of stations with: 1) sampling focused on the plankton component of juvenile salmon diets (krill, amphipods, and decapod larvae); 2) biochemical measurements of zooplankton production rates and photochemical measurements of phytoplankton production rates; and 3) ancillary measurements required for estimates of food web energy transfer efficiency. The primary objective is to measure the quantity, quality, and production rate of a key dietary component as well as the entire zooplankton community. Variation of zooplankton production rates are more sensitive than biomass to environmental variation occurring on timescales relevant to juvenile salmon foraging. Community-level productivity estimates will be used to measure ecological efficiency; the amount of energy available to consumers of zooplankton.

2025-2026,2430,Feasibility of Estimating Chilko River Smolt Abundance Using Upward- and Side-Looking SONAR Methods,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Daniel Doutaz,Submitted,"Chilko Sockeye salmon represent the only wild Sockeye indicator stock in the Fraser watershed. The annual Chilko Lake Sockeye smolt assessment (1951-present) comprises the only long-term time series data available to assess juvenile recruitment, and freshwater and marine productivity for wild Fraser River Sockeye salmon. Since program inception, Sockeye smolts have been enumerated during their out-migration from Chilko Lake using a traditional fish counting weir and photographic sampling/counting techniques. During the first six decades of the program (1951-2012), interruptions in weir operation were relatively rare: in only three years (1979, 1993, 2006) did early freshets necessitate removal of the weir before the vast majority of smolts had migrated from Chilko Lake.

Recently, unusually early freshets have been experienced in the Chilko watershed that have translated into high and variable water conditions much earlier in the season. As such, DFO Stock Assessment crews were not able to operate the weir in 2015 due to high water flows, and have had to remove the weir structure prior to the completion of smolt migration on numerous other recent years (e.g., 2019). The observed increase in the frequency of early freshets in the Chilko watershed is consistent with predicted hydrographic changes for interior BC streams as a whole in response to climate variability, with the average timing of the spring freshet expected to continue shifting earlier as air temperatures rise. The future of operating the Chilko Sockeye smolt weir is in jeopardy given the current trend related to the timing, frequency, and strength of the spring freshets. If proven effective, the SONAR method would provide an alternate assessment method for the Chilko watershed that could be quickly employed in years when high flows either prevent the installation of the weir at the beginning of the migration, or necessitate the removal of the weir before the smolt migration is largely complete.

The objective of this work is to test the feasibility of using upward-looking SONAR technology to assess daily abundances of Chilko Lake sockeye smolts as they migrate downstream through the Chilko River. This technology has proven to be effective for enumerating migrating smolts in comparable rivers in Alaska. The reliably of the method will be evaluated based on how well the daily SONAR-derived abundance indices predict the daily migration totals observed at the counting weir that is deployed annually on the Chilko River. A pilot study employing this technology was initiated within the Chilko watershed in the spring of 2021, and following two consecutive years of data collection the results appear to be promising; however, in both 2021 and 2022, water levels have been below seasonal averages and we have yet to experience a high-water event with the SONARs in place. Additional years of this project are therefore required before any conclusions can be made regarding the effectiveness of this technology as a substitute for the currently employed counting weir on the Chilko River.

The specific case study that we will use as a proof of concept for this technology is the GREB1L gene in Puntledge River Chinook Salmon. GREB1L is a gene that explains a large amount of the variation in run timing for Chinook Salmon. Specific SNPs in the GREB1L gene are currently used as diagnostic genetic markers to retroactively distinguish between summer and fall runs of Chinook in the Puntledge River Hatchery. These markers have two alleles one of which is primarily carried by early returning Chinook Salmon and the other by late returning salmon. Current management of enhancement at the Puntledge River Hatchery uses a date threshold to ensure most ""summer run"" fish carry the early-run allele to preserve the genetic integrity of this population segment. Rapid in-season genotyping results would allow more accurate and expanded use of available broodstock for the Puntledge summer run. SHERLOCK assays are field deployable genotyping assays that can generate a result in under an hour and may provide this capacity to enhancement efforts in the Puntledge River. The technology has previously been demonstrated for rapid genotyping purposes including GREB1L markers in California populations of Chinook Salmon.

While stock delineation using the existing SNP panel is close to Conservation Unit-level resolution, there remain difficult delineations to make that are of interest to stock assessment and management. For year 1, the focus will be predominately on the lower Fraser, where delineation of Chilliwack River from the remaining lower Fraser populations remains difficult in the current analysis methods but is desired to support management objectives. To better understand what differentiates these populations, we will use next generation sequencing technologies to perform low-coverage whole genome sequencing on a selection of spawning populations in the lower Fraser, Chilliwack River, and select populations in the Salish sea in the first year - this will include enhanced stocks from each region. Future analyses will identify where differences stocks exist and allow for the selection of genetic markers to better delineate among them, thereby allowing for more accurate assessment and enhancement methods using genetic techniques.

2025-2026,2437,Adaptive genetic variation and climate change resilience in Canadian Pacific salmon,PSSI (B-base),Biotechnology and Genomics,"Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband",Approved,"Pacific salmon are broadly distributed across western Canada and the northern Pacific Ocean with spawning grounds located over a wide diversity of freshwater habitats. In general, Pacific salmon return to their natal spawning grounds to reproduce, and not surprisingly this has resulted in substantial genetic variation among different salmon populations throughout the Canadian range. Genetic variants among and within populations of the majority of Canadian Pacific salmon have been characterized using relatively low numbers of genetic markers, and this characterization has enabled the development of the genetic-stock identification and parentage-based tagging programs within Fisheries and Oceans Canada which provide vital information for management of fisheries and hatcheries. Despite the utility of these developments, low-density genetic markers are insufficient to assess adaptive genetic variation in these species, leaving critical gaps for conserving fitness-associated genetic diversity and for improving resilience to climate change. Previously, the costs of next-generation sequencing were prohibitive for assessing genome-wide genetic variation in species with large genomes such as salmonids. However, reductions in these costs combined with publication of reference genome sequences for the Pacific salmonids has opened novel opportunities to address these gaps. The proposed project will utilize low-coverage whole-genome resequencing to assess genome-wide patterns of genetic variation among and within populations of Pacific salmon. These data will feed into several analyses to identify genomic regions and variation involved in environmental adaptation, to reassess the genetic support for currently defined conservation unit boundaries, and to estimate the relative climate change resilience of different populations of Canadian Pacific salmon. Initially, the proposed project will focus on Chinook and Sockeye Salmon with a goal of sequencing individuals from 48 populations of each species distributed across the species’ range. We will leverage samples currently available in the Molecular Genetics DNA archives to enable these efforts. In the longer-term, the objectives of this project will expand these sequencing efforts to increase the coverage of individuals, populations and species of Pacific salmon. This expansion of scope will be necessary to fully consider conservation of within population genetic diversity, and to resolve parallel patterns of genetic adaptation across Pacific salmon in Canada. The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Identify 48 populations representative of the range-wide diversity of Chinook and Sockeye Salmon. 2) Obtain samples from 18 Chinook individuals or 8 Sockeye individuals from each identified population from the Molecular Genetics DNA archives, and extract DNA for each sample. 3) Prepare the extracted DNA samples for low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, and submit the samples to an external sequencing service provider. 4) Collect relevant environmental datasets and climate change projections for the locations and life histories of the identified populations. 5) Receive sequencing reads for all submitted DNA samples. The long-term objectives of the study are: 6) Align sequencing reads from the first year of the study to the Chinook or Sockeye Salmon reference genomes. 7) Determine allele frequency variation among and within populations of each species. 8) Analyze genome-wide population structure in each species and identify outlier regions of genetic differentiation among populations. 9) Analyze genome-environment associations to resolve environmental factors underlying genetic differentiation among populations. 10) Utilize current inter-population genomic variation to determine “genomic offsets” in the context of climate change projections (i.e., the extent of genetic change necessary to parallel expected changes in the environment). 11) Expand sampling and sequencing effort to include Chum, Pink and Coho Salmon, and to add additional Chinook and Sockeye Salmon population that address any gaps in the initial analysis. 12) Repeat the analyses above across species to evaluate cross-species patterns and factors important to Pacific salmon adaptation in Canada. 13) Report on genome-wide genetic variation in comparison to existing conservation unit boundaries with dedicated consideration of putatively adaptive genetic variation. 14) Report on genetic estimates of relative climate change resilience among different populations of each Pacific salmon species examined.

2025-2026,2439,Modernizing Fish Age Estimation using Fourier Transform-Near Infrared and Neural Network Techniques,PSSI (B-base),Biotechnology and Genomics,Stephen Wischniowski,Approved,"The Sclerochronology Lab (SCL) provides a unique central service for Pacific Regional DFO clientele involved in the management of commercially important species of salmon, herring, groundfish and shellfish by providing users with consistent high quality age estimates, monitoring growth patterns influenced by environmental pressures, and providing products and services developed through strategic, innovative and collaborative research programs. Age information is a key piece of data used by biologists to assess the health of marine fin/shellfish populations (Ricker 1975; Hilborn and Walters 1992; Campana and Thorrold 2001). Age structured stock assessments facilitate judicious fisheries resource management decisions commonly via CSAS processes which depend on high quality and consistent age-data. Commercial Fisheries programs are managed in partnership with stakeholders relying on scientific assessments and are dependent on consultative processes to develop and review policies, procedures and regulations.

SCL intellectual knowledge achieved through the experience of long-term observations (40+yrs) (Campana, 1992; Hesler et al., 2019) is safeguarded not only in documentation, but more so as a living document in the staff's collective ability to recognize and identify growth patterns. To maintain this continuous and uninterrupted level of service the SCL relies on a comprehensive training regime designed specifically to withstand sporadic events of attrition including the loss of knowledge by way of retirements. Managing staff changes in the SCL, particularly retirements post 2020 has seen an unprecedented number of senior staff retire, fundamentally challenging the SCL’s ability to maintain the forementioned scope of training and intellectual knowledge. The SCL, and other Committee of Fish Ageing Experts (CARE) agencies are recognizing that the reliance on traditional ways of fish age estimation may not be sustainable as demands only seem to increase while the ability to retain knowledgeable staff diminishes.

The SCL has initiated investigations into alternative means of estimating fish age. Fourier Transform-Near Infrared (FT-NIR) Spectroscopy and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently gained attention in the ability to reproduce accurate age assignments when calibrated against known age, or the best age that can be provided, to produced results complimentary to the traditional means of estimation fish age. Both techniques require continuous “training” or “maintenance” to ensure that all variations of patterned growth both spatial and temporarily are experienced by the algorithm. Once sufficient volume has been attained the output capacity and time required to produce age assignments is substantially faster than what can be attained by traditional ageing.

Fourier Transform-Near Infrared. FT-NIR spectroscopy has recently been applied to rapidly predict fish age, gaining attention among fisheries managers as a potential alternative to timely and costly production ageing of managed species (Passerotti et al., 2020). Age prediction capability of FT-NIRS has been tested on the otoliths of chinook salmon (Claiborne et al., 2019), walleye pollock (Hesler et al., 2019), red snapper (Passerotti et al., 2020), barramundi (Wright et al., 2021), Pacific cod (Healy et al., 2021), longnose skate (Arrington et al., 2021) as well as the vertebrae of two shark species (Rigby et al. 2014, 2016), with potentially promising results. Studies on eastern Bering Sea walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) have shown that ages derived from FT-NIRS are not only precise but may demonstrate less bias than traditional ageing methods (Helser et al., 2018). Studies conducted by collaborators at NOAA have indicated that FT-NIRS has the capacity to increase age outputs of walleye pollock from 35 ages per day to 360 ages per day (Hesler et al., 2019). If successful, new applications of FT-NIRS technology will provide a promising approach to consolidate research tools, operationalize timely data collection methods for age determination directly benefiting fisheries researchers and managers, as well as other research projects led by StAR, SEP, and Indigenous communities.

Convolutional Neural Networks. Significant progress in use of automated pattern recognition based on machine learning has been achieved in recent years. The availability of deep learning packages for open-source software has provided the opportunity to analyze large volumes of unstructured data (e.g., images, video, audio, etc.) quickly and efficiently (Polacek et al. 2022). These advancements in deep learning have proven effective at solving a range of complex problems related to unstructured data in many disciplines, including the age assignments of otoliths and scales of teleost’s (Cayetano et al. 2024, Moen et al. 2018 and Vabo et al. 2021). The SCL is working in collaboration with the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSFRC) in the development of a computer vision (CHUMputer Vision) pipeline to predict the age assignments of Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) by way of digitized scale images. Both the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) and the Pacific Biological Station will provide selected pre-aged scale images of Chum (age range 0 to 7 yrs.) to train the Python data pipeline code. To ensure model robustness sufficient samples of all age ranges must be configured. Currently, sufficient age classes of 03 and 04 (European age classification) are contained. The Sclerochronology Lab will sources shoulder year age classes, assist in imaging, preprocess enhancement and model testing. Chum have been selected for their ease of interpretation of the non-freshwater pattern. Ultimately however, the goal is to reach algorithm sophistication to interpret the complexities of freshwater growth patterns, to which age assignments can be estimated for Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha).

2025-2026,2442,Graduate Research into 1) habitat use by juvenile Chinook Salmon in the Canadian Okanagan River and Lake system and 2) predation on juvenile salmon in the Canadian Okanagan River and Lake system,PSSI (B-base),Freshwater Habitat Research,"Lauren Weir, Tommy Pontbriand",Approved,"Okanagan Chinook are the only remaining Columbia River Chinook Salmon population in Canada. Their abundance is very low, currently less than a couple hundred spawners, but their abundance was likely in the high thousands before the Canadian Okanagan and Columbia River were developed for Agriculture, Flood Control, and Hydro-power Generation, resulting in physical exclusion from spawning and rearing habitats. Fishing rates have also been high through history, with recent (2009-2018) exploitation rates around 60%. The population in the U.S. section of the Okanagan River has recently ranged from 7,000-14,000 spawners.

COSEWIC has identified this single river Designatable Unit as ENGANGERED, and it is currently undergoing review for listing under the Species at Risk Act. Additionally, this stock is part of Batch 1 for the Fish Stock Provisions under the Fisheries Act. The DFO has considerable engagement with First Nations, the Okanagan Water Management Board, the Okanagan River Restoration Initiative, as well as the Colville Confederated Tribes, the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Pacific Salmon Commission. Rebuilding the abundance of Okanagan Chinook is a priority for First Nations and local, provincial, and national fisheries agencies on both sides of the boarder.

Recently, the Pacific Salmon Commission conducted a series of 5 workshops with fisheries professionals and First Nations which examined threats, impediments to survival, and mitigation approaches to increase the abundance of Okanagan Chinook. Similarly, a Recovery Potential Assessment (DFO Pacific Region CSAS) and DFO Risk Assessment Methods (RAMS) have been applied and also identified threats and mitigations. Among the issues identified in these assessments, the key ones include Climate Change and its influence on the thermal and hydrological regime of the Okanagan, channelization and the disconnection of the main river channels from the historic and off-channel stream habitats, and predation by invasive fish species. Two of the data gaps that were highlighted from this work are the juvenile habitat use in the Okanagan, which has been highly disturbed and degraded, and the level of predation on juvenile Chinook salmon by native and non-native fishes. To enable rebuilding it will be essential to have information on habitat use and to understand the threat posed by predation. Graduate students provide the most efficient way to answer these critical research questions. The use of graduate students will allow for targeted and timely research while building capacity and knowledge for when they enter the workforce.

2025-2026,2444,Assessment of the distribution and abundance of juvenile Chinook salmon in the lower Thompson River basin.,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Colin Bailey,Approved,"The overall objective of the project is to obtain annual estimates of fall (October) standing stock for chinook fry in principal spawning tributaries and the mainstem of the lower Thompson River, and to describe, quantitatively, the uncertainty associated with these estimates. The work will be completed by an independent contractor who conducted similar studies previously (200-2012) and is familiar with the area and study design.

The field work will consist of calibrated night snorkeling surveys (Hagen et al. 2010) in the Lower Thompson River System including all major spawning tributaries (Nicola, Coldwater, Spius, Deadman, Criss, Bonaparte, and Thompson River mainstem) and subsequent data analysis and reporting over the winter months. It will draw closely on the previous steelhead and Chinook juvenile assessments completed by the contractor in the lower Thompson River system for both the design of field and analysis methods. Results from this work will contribute to the time series of juvenile abundance gathered over 10 years from 2001 to 2012 and the subsequent analysis.

This information will contribute to an assessment of ongoing impacts of the historic 2021 flood on Nicola 42 Chinook egg-to-fry survival and recruitment and will lead to a better understanding of the impacts of catastrophic flooding on salmonids generally and provide specific insights into Nicola recruitment and juvenile use of the post flood system. This information may provide insights into management decisions as well as on prioritizing watershed restoration activities. Additionally, this project could build on the previous fry assessment work to provide useful information about stock productivity and carrying capacity, and aid in developing escapement goals and recovery planning.

2025-2026,2447,Innovative Ecosystem Based Approaches to identify cumulative stressors: Salmon Fit-Chips and eDNA,PSSI (B-base),Biotechnology and Genomics,"Kristi Saunders, Arthur Bass, Christoph Deeg, Carl Llewellyn",Approved,"Climate change has negatively impacted productivity of many Canadian Pacific salmon stocks and species, but the cumulative interplay between environmental stress and changes to salmon ecosystems impacting survival are still yet to be fully evaluated. This knowledge is required to identify effective mediation strategies under anthropogenic control. An innovative salmon Fit-Chip tool is poised to fill this knowledge gap. The salmon Fit-Chip tool contains curated biomarker panels that can specifically recognize independent stressors (thermal, osmotic, hypoxia), disease states (viral), imminent mortality (natural death within 72 hours), and smolt readiness (differentiating pre-smolts, smolts and de-smolts), based on profiling from non-lethal gill biopsy samples. Fit-chips also contain biomarkers associated with inflammation and immune activation, and can include assays to key pathogens and parasites.

While physical oceanographic monitoring can provide environmental measures of temperature, oxygen, and salinity, they do not tell us whether fish are actually experiencing stress, or possibly avoiding areas where these stressors occur. Fit-Chip data allow us to directly test whether the highest ranking environmental risk factors identified in the WCVI Marine Risk Assessments—elevated temperature summer through early fall and reduced oxygen in the fall, the moderate risk of carryover effects (in this case smolt readiness rather than size) and exposure to HABs, cause physiological stress and impairment in Chinook salmon. Moreover, Fit-Chips can effectively identify habitats where salmon are least vs most compromised, allowing regulators and habitat biologists to target remediation where needed most, with remediation success tracked via decreased stress.

Working within the West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) ""Follow the fish"" Research Consortium funded under PSSI, under objective 1, we will run Fit-Chips on 2,000 Chinook released from Robertson and Nitinat hatcheries sampled over the migration trajectory from freshwater-estuary-marine, including overwintering Chinook caught across all 5 WCVI sounds through microtrolling led by local First Nations. Using a south coast wide Fit-Chip dataset developed in 2022-2023 using PSSI funding, comprised of over 4500 Chinook sampled from 2008-2018, we will employ stock-recruitment models to identify associations between individual stressors and population-level survival across the southern BC coast, and build a new model framework to address the cumulative interplay between stress and disease undermining survival. This analysis will address several of the risk factors identified in the WCVI Marine Risk Assessment for Chinook salmon, including climate-driven environmental stressors (temperature, hypoxia, salinity) and pathogens/disease, and their association with survival. We will then apply this knowledge to our Fit-Chip data on WCVI Chinook collected from 2022-2024, along with the physical oceanographic data collected at the same time, to identify where and when environmental stressors are “felt” by WCVI Chinook, including their relationship with measured environmental parameters, and where and when signs of increased morbidity occur. Importantly, this spatial analysis will also address the anthropogenically controlled intrinsic and extrinsic factors associated with stressors and diseases that pose the highest population-level risk to WCVI Chinook. The ultimate goal is to identify stressor and/or disease impacts that can be effectively mediated to increase early marine survival of salmon, and habitats where mediation is most urgently required.

The WCVI Marine Risk Assessments identified prey availability/feeding a high current and future risk, pathogens/parasites a moderate current and high future risk, and predation/HABs a moderate risks. Data gaps were identified for all of these risk factors. While multiple individual projects are proposed to tackle most of these risk factors and where they are most strongly felt in Barclay and Clayoquot Sound, eDNA offers a more holistic tool to identify the species compositions – e.g. salmon spp, predators, prey, competitors, infective agents, HABs, that can corroborate community assessment more efficiently over a broader spatial scale. Under objective 2, we will carry out eDNA sampling in the same areas and seasons where the follow the fish project is actively catching fish, starting in the estuaries and Barclay Sound in spring/summer, and moving into Clayoquot sound in the early fall and throughout all five sounds overwinter. In addition to providing an ecosystem characterization via metabarcoding, and pathogens through our infective agent monitoring system -- including potential hot-spot areas around farms/processing plants, eDNA may also provide more information on areas of the sound where salmon are more or less abundant. Importantly, under this objective we will integrate data analyses with projects using a more traditional species assessments (e.g. via plankton sampling, HAB monitoring, hydroacoustics). Importantly, when contrasting eDNA community compositions in ecosystems where salmon show indices of optimal vs compromised health, we can provide a second pillar to develop and measure the effectiveness of mediation efforts.

In 2025-2026 we will target these factors for detailed spatiotemporal analysis and conduct analyses connecting Fit-Chip and eDNA data as described in the following objectives:

1. Fit-Chip analysis of microtroll collected Chinook indicated a much higher prevalence of hypoxia stress in the wild than anticipated based on the laboratory challenge studies where extremely low levels of oxygen were required to elicit a stress response. Initial results indicate that hypoxia signals were strong at inlet heads where previous oceanographic studies have identified low oxygen levels in corresponding seasons. Spatio-temporal models, an early version of which identified the aforementioned signal, will be further developed to include other potential sources of hypoxia stress, including gill pathogens and harmful algal blooms (HABs), the presence of which can be determined by eDNA. We are collaborating with DFO specialists working on HABs in WCVI to build a multifactorial model (Andrew Ross et al.).

2. Prevalence and infection density of Tenacibaculum maritimum in Fit-Chip data from purse seine collected Chinook salmon exceeded levels previously observed in any field study (molecular or otherwise) of wild salmonids (close to 100% prevalence on some sampling days). This bacterium has been found to cause rapid mortality in salmonids and has been negatively associated with population-level survival in BC Chinook salmon. It is a common cause of salmon health events in BC netpen aquaculture and is elevated in the water around active pens. We observed T. maritimum detections in more northerly sounds sampled in the fall, coincident with detections in eDNA associated with aquaculture. An ongoing sequence-based epidemiology study will determine whether T. maritimum strains vary between sounds or there is some level of connectivity between sounds. We will also conduct statistical analyses to check for associations between T. maritimum and the many physiological, morphological, and clinical variables in our dataset. Additionally, we may be able to compare T. maritimum levels to CPUE data (or perhaps acoustic monitoring data). For this infectious agent, and other high ranking pathogens run on Fit-Chips, we will check for correlations with corresponding eDNA measurements and the aforementioned metrics of fish health. Another agent, Paranucleospora theridion, which has previously demonstrated associations with aquaculture and sea lice, appeared at much higher frequency in Clayoquot Sound relative to other inlets. Like T. maritimum, P. theridion was statistically associated with Atlantic salmon detections in eDNA samples. We will employ multiple statistical approaches to test for a relationship between this pathogen and aquaculture, including models of infestation pressure and distance to active netpens. The same approach could be applied to other agents where a biological mechanism is expected. Agents of particular interest are Atlantic salmon calicivirus, Cutthroat trout virus-2, Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi, Tenacibaculum finmarkense,  and Piscirickettsia salmonis, all of which were positively associated with Atlantic salmon eDNA detections and thus aquaculture.

3. MGL has recently developed a starvation panel for use on the Fit-Chip that determines when fish present gene expression signals indicating food deprivation. As starvation was a primary hypothesized driver coming out of the WCVI Chinook marine risk assessment process, we will apply this new panel on select samples to identify spatio-temporal patterns in starvation. We will compare Fit-Chip starvation data to stomach sample analysis (Bokvist et al.), eDNA data characterizing salmon prey distribution (Gauthier et al.), and plankton data (Sastri et al.). Together, this data should allow us to identify spatiotemporal hotspots of good and poor dietary conditions for juvenile salmon.   

4. While thermal stress was not detected in microtroll samples collected from October through May across years (as expected), there was a strong thermal stress signal detected in Barkley purse seine collected Chinook in 2022 (as hypothesized during the WCVI Chinook risk assessment process). 2023 and 2024 purse seine samples will be run on Fit-Chips to determine whether this pattern is consistent across years. In order to understand potential impacts to wild stocks, additional sampling of fish and eDNA from more northerly sounds (i.e. Nootka and Kyuquot) during July and August would be beneficial in 2025. Statistical analyses will be conducted to identify other stressors, including pathogens, that are associated with exposure to high water temperatures (HWT). Through the use of eDNA data, this analysis will also explore how salmon ecosystems change with increasing SST in order to inform changing ecosystem dynamics under climate change

5. Next to the above mentioned observations, eDNA analysis was able to provide coarse spatiotemporal distribution patterns for all pacific salmon, as well as cutthroat trout, steelhead and Dolly Varden, that largely agreed with the spatiotemporal distribution of salmonids from microtrolling data. In total, eDNA metabarcoding was able to identifying 1146 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from viruses and bacteria, algae, zooplankton, nekton, salmonids, to marine mammals including whales, highlighting the complexity and diversity of the marine ecosystems of WCVI. Preliminary network analysis indicates ecosystem wide changes associated with aquaculture, as Atlantic salmon detections correlated with the presence of several HABs, microorganisms like amoebas, algae, cnidarians, bryozoans and numerous benthic polychaetes. This could potentially be related to nutrient loading by aquaculture., a hypothesis we will investigate in 2025/2026. Strikingly, aquaculture was also associated with forage fish and predators, including steelhead, coho, Dolly Varden, cutthroat, and Chinook, suggesting that salmonids with extended coastal life histories are attracted to high biomass areas such as aquaculture sites.  Chinook showed a strong aversion to HABs that were not associated with aquaculture, but no such relationship was observed with aquaculture associated HABs. In 2025/2026 we will investigate whether Chinook risk exposure to HABs in order to avail themselves of the feeding opportunities associated with aquaculture facilities. For 2025-2026, we will shift our focus into continued sampling of Barkley, Nootka, and Kyuquot Sounds in order to be able to compare northern and southern Sounds with different oceanographic features and anthropogenic impacts. Analysis will focus on detailed spatiotemporal breakdown of shifts in habitat usage by Chinook and the underlying changes in ecosystem composition in an attempt to identify the drivers of fish health events identified by Fit-Chips. 

6. It is expected that in the third year of PSSI, stock assessment will provide an additional modeler to work collaboratively with Bass, Llewellyn, Deeg, and possibly others to build the most comprehensive, data-driven modeling to address the cumulative and synergistic interplay between key factors undermining salmon condition and survival identified in the WCVI Chinook Marine Risk Assessments, including prey availability, environmental stress (climate and anthropogenic), pathogens, toxicants/harmful algae, predators, competition, and freshwater carryover effects.",,No,,,Yes,We will require a DFO truck to facilitate eDNA collections on a monthly basis.,Yes,"In 2023-24, we used a private boat that was loaned to our program to carry out eDNA sampling during summer, and borrowed the herring vessel (Pallasii) for fall/winter sampling.

2025-2026,2448,"Developing a proactive, modernized, holistic approach to ensure optimal health and condition of Hatchery Production",PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,"Kristi Saunders, Karia Kaukinen, Arthur Bass",Approved,"In years 1 and 2, a proactive holistic health monitoring approach based on high throughput molecular technologies was validated for utility in two salmon enhancement hatcheries, and is now ready in year 3 for minimally invasive application in hatcheries culturing conservation stocks, the objective from the start of the program. The technical approach revealed annual shifts in stress, infection, and timing of smolt readiness identified through salmon Fit-Chips, and eDNA analyses found the source water to be a major determinate of infections in hatchery cohorts. As such, future monitoring of pathogens in hatchery source water will be crucial to minimize infection potential and maximize post-release survival in stocks of conservation concern. Moreover, monitoring of water from natal watersheds where conservation stocks will be released is also critical to understand whether hatchery production may risk the introduction of pathogens not detected in those watersheds, and to guide mitigation measures, if necessary.

Overview of past and future approach:

Two modern molecular-based approaches have been successfully applied to assess shifts in holistic health of hatchery cohorts: 1) Salmon Fit-Chips applied to gill biopsy samples to assess stress, infection, disease, and smolt readiness, and 2) environmental RNA (eRNA) applied to source water coming into the hatchery and culture tanks/ponds to monitor presence and abundance of dozens of pathogens and parasites. After two years of validation at two enhancement hatcheries, these technologies are deployment ready for non-lethal application in hatcheries culturing stocks of conservation concern.

In 2022-2024, enhancement stock cohorts at Nitinat and Robertson Creek hatcheries were sampled bi-weekly/monthly over two years of production. A database to capture meta and molecular data, and scripts for semi-automated reporting were developed. Fit-Chip data revealed shifting levels of thermal and oxygen stress across hatchery cohorts in the first year, and no apparent stress in the second year. Viral disease associated with PSnV infection in gill tissue was associated with hypoxia stress and morbidity at one hatchery. Altering source water resulted in a shift in pathogen profiles in fish across hatcheries. In 2023, only 50% of Chinook reached full smolt status at the time of release, whereas over 90% of fish were full smolts at release in 2024 across both hatcheries.

In 2025-2026, a minimally invasive approach will be applied to up to 8 Conservation Hatchery Stocks cultured across 4-6 hatcheries, with SEP management making the final determinations of stocks that will benefit most from proactive health monitoring. Gill biopsies from all moribund fish and bi-weekly collection of water filters for eRNA will be collected by hatchery staff, with preserved samples mailed bi-weekly to PBS. water will be sampled both from tanks and source water into the hatcheries, as well, when possible, the water where conservation stocks will be released. This is critical to understand if there are pathogens that these stocks may pick up in the hatchery that are not detected in their natural environments. Hatchery staff will be provided training and sampling kits by January 2025. Molecular analyses of gill and water samples would be processed simultaneously for all participating hatcheries upon receipt, and bi-weekly reports sent back to hatcheries. Hatchery managers can use this information to address husbandry needs that minimize infection/stress and guide release timing to optimize post-release survival.

2025-2026,2451,Relative reproductive success of hatchery- versus natural-origin salmon in Canadian integrated populations,PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,"Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband",Approved,"Enhancement of Pacific salmon through hatchery production is a key component of supporting wild salmon populations. Objectives of hatchery enhancement span conserving at-risk stocks, rebuilding lower abundance stocks, providing harvest opportunities and increasing public awareness through outreach and education. However, there are also risks associated with hatchery enhancement; differences between a hatchery and a natural habitat affect both the genetic and environmental factors that shape the performance and fitness of salmon. Consequently, hatchery-origin salmon may be less suited to wild habitats than their natural-origin counterparts, and the presence of hatchery-origin fish on a natural spawning ground may reduce the fitness of a population overall. The relative fitness of hatchery-origin compared to natural-origin salmon has been estimated in a handful of systems through determination of relative reproductive success (RRS). In these studies, returning adults are assigned back to their parents using genetic tags called parentage-based tags, and RRS is inferred by the number of returns per family from hatchery-origin compared to natural-origin parents. In general, the results of RRS studies suggest that hatchery-origin fish have lower natural reproductive success than natural-origin fish, and this reduced RRS is potentially transferred across generations. Despite this pattern, the extent to which hatchery-origin fitness is lower than natural-origin fitness is likely dependent on current and historical factors impacting specific systems, including hatchery practices. To date, no study has estimated the RRS of hatchery- and natural-origin Pacific salmonids in integrated populations enhanced by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). This is a critical knowledge gap for effectively managing hatchery production, as genetic management of these systems currently assumes a RRS of 0.8. This value is a reasonable consensus value from published estimates in USA rivers, but the SEP has had clear guidelines for genetic management since at least the 1980s, and it is possible that RRS estimates from USA hatcheries are inaccurate for SEP hatcheries. Utilization of an inaccurate RRS estimate could result in mismanagement of genetic risks associated with hatchery production, because the number of hatchery-origin fish that are predicted to utilize the natural spawning grounds increases as RRS increases, whereas a high RRS infers relatively low negative consequences for fitness associated with hatchery-origin spawners. Therefore, accurate estimation of RRS is important for effective genetic management of SEP hatcheries, particularly in the context of managing the influences of the hatchery and natural environments on the adaptive trajectories of integrated populations (i.e., proportionate natural influence or “PNI”). The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Initiate extensive genetic sampling of both the escapement and broodstock for at least one Pacific salmon population enhanced by the SEP (confirmed population: Sarita River Chinook Salmon). 2) Use a genetic biomarker panel to genotype these natural-origin and hatchery-origin parents. 3) Explore alternative approaches to enable widespread RRS estimation across SEP hatcheries even in systems where extensively escapement sampling is infeasible. The long-term objectives of the study are: 4) Explore options to increase sampling efforts to approach comprehensive escapement sampling in future years. 5) Continue these genetic sampling efforts to derive parentage-based tags for returning adults from both hatchery-origin and natural-origin production. 6) Estimate RRS in SEP hatcheries to allow improved management of genetic risks associated with hatchery influences.

2025-2026,2452,Genetic associations with age of return in male Canadian Chinook Salmon,PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,"Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband",Approved,"Chinook Salmon display arguably the widest range of life history strategies of all Pacific salmonids. One important life history strategy in male Chinooks is to return after one fewer year in the marine environment than the earliest returning females. These early-returning males or “jacks” are relatively small, and participate in spawning by employing an opportunistic “sneaker” strategy to fertilize small numbers of eggs from many spawning events involving females and larger, more dominant, males. In general, spawning success in Chinook Salmon is closely related to size; however, jacks experience the risk marine predation for at least one less year than other males, and the success of jacks is a product of negative frequency-dependent selection. In other words, as the proportion of large males increases, the relative success of jacks increases, whereas as the proportion of jacks increases, the relative success of jacks decreases. In addition, from an evolutionary perspective jack males represent an important natural avenue of gene flow between different spawning years in Pacific salmon species. Therefore, the natural occurrence of low frequencies of jack males in Chinook Salmon populations is likely beneficial for the population and species as a whole. There are both genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the tendency of a male Chinook to return as a jack, and current understanding suggests that growth rates at early life stages combined with size-at-age thresholds play key roles in the likelihood of observing the jack phenotype later in life. These factors suggest that hatchery enhancement may artificially raise the proportion of jack males in a population, and this has been observed in some hatchery lines. Despite the importance of the jack life history strategy overall, there is no doubt that larger Chinook males are more successful on the spawning grounds, and larger salmon are more valuable to fisheries. Consequently, there are concerns that hatchery enhancement may shift the distribution of ages of return towards younger age classes with negative consequences for both harvest and population-level fitness. To mitigate the risk of shifting a population’s average age of return, hatcheries may manage jacks in broodstock differently than other males by preferentially retaining older males. The jack phenotype is known to be inherited to a reasonable extent, and thus this broodstock screening should counter the likelihood of overrepresentation of jack fathers in hatchery-origin offspring. However, as genetic and environmental factors impact the tendency to jack, broodstock management would be improved and facilitated if jacks among the potential brood could be screened specifically for the genetic factors underlying the jack phenotype; these factors are the most likely to directly impact the proportion of jacks in the subsequent generation of hatchery-origin offspring. Recent research has shown that specific y-chromosome haplotypes are strongly associated with the tendency of a male to return as a jack, but these haplotypes are unique to different regions. Y-chromosome haplotypes in Canadian Chinook Salmon have not be characterized in the context of ages of return for any population, impairing the ability to develop genetic tools to refine hatchery broodstock management. Therefore, resolving the genetic variants responsible for known inheritance of the jack life history strategy is an important step in improving genetic hatchery management in the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Identify males of known age classes from previously genotyped broodstock from three Chinook populations enhanced by SEP (confirmed populations: Chilliwack River Fall, Puntledge River Fall and Qualicum River). 2) Perform reduced-representation sequencing on 256 males from each population across age classes with approximately 80 jacks per population. 3) Analyze genotype-phenotype associations between genetic variants and the age of return among individuals, including a specific analysis of y-chromosome haplotypes. The long-term objectives of the study are: 4) Expand these analyses to include additional SEP-enhanced Chinook populations from other regions to confirm the generality of genetic associations. 5) Design genetic tools to allow rapid screening of genetic variants that have large effects on the tendency of a male Chinook to return as a jack. 6) Potentially expand these analyses to examine genetic associations with age of return in female Chinook, which would also support genetic management of SEP broodstocks.

2025-2026,2453,Epigenetic variation between hatchery- and natural-origin Canadian Chinook Salmon,PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,"Eric Rondeau, Timothy Healy, Kyle Wellband",Approved,"Enhancement of Pacific salmon through hatchery production is a key component of supporting wild salmon populations.

However, there are also risks associated with hatchery enhancement; differences between a hatchery and a natural habitat affect both the genetic and environmental factors that shape the performance and fitness of salmon. Consequently, hatchery-origin salmon may be less suited to wild habitats than their natural-origin counterparts, and the presence of hatchery-origin fish on a natural spawning ground may reduce the fitness of a population overall. Despite the known risks and consequences of hatchery enhancement, major genetic differences between hatchery-origin and natural-origin salmonids as a result of hatchery-mediated selection or relaxed selection have generally not been observed in integrated populations. In contrast, substantial epigenetic differences have been detected between hatchery-origin and natural-origin Pacific salmonids. Epigenetic variants are structural changes to DNA without a change in the DNA sequence itself. For example, DNA methylation is a commonly studied epigenetic mechanism in which a methyl group (-CH3) is covalently added to a cytosine residue. These modifications to DNA can alter the function of the genome, particularly through the regulation of gene expression. Given the extent of variation in epigenetic signatures between hatchery-origin and natural-origin salmon, the functional effects of epigenetic variants are excellent candidates to underlie the fitness consequences associated with hatchery enhancement. Additionally, it is possible for hatchery epigenetic variants to be inherited by the offspring of hatchery-origin fish, which aligns with the potential for long-term reductions in population fitness as hatchery-origin fish spawn in natural habitats. The study of epigenetic variation in Pacific salmonids is relatively in its infancy, but epigenetic biomarkers are a promising tool to facilitate managing hatchery enhancement specifically and salmon fisheries generally. A critical knowledge gap in the generation of these tools is that epigenetic differences between hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook Salmon have not been well-characterized within enhanced populations or across populations enhanced by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). Therefore, a comprehensive examination of DNA methylation between hatchery- and natural-origin Canadian Chinook Salmon is a high priority, which will be followed by the development of epigenetic biomarkers and tools for monitoring and management. The first-year objectives of the study are: 1) Identify hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook Salmon in broodstock from five SEP hatcheries through assignments of parentage-based tags (confirmed hatchery lines: Nicola River, Quinsam River, Sarita River, Atnarko River Upper, Chilliwack River Fall, Chilliwack River Summer). 2) Utilize enzymatic methyl sequencing to assess DNA methylation patterns among female and male hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook Salmon across difference age classes of return. 3) Determine hatchery-origin epigenetic variants that are: common across all hatcheries studied, specific to individual hatcheries, associated with physiological performance, associated with sex, or associated with age of return. 4) Identify candidate epigenomic biomarkers for use in high-throughput molecular tools to support monitoring and management decisions.

2025-2026,2493,Improved understanding of cumulative impacts on salmon survival across freshwater life-stages; tools and approaches for mechanistic assessments,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,"David Patterson, Douglas Braun",Approved,"Context: Landscape level assessments of stressors on aquatic habitats, climate change projections, and population dynamics models can provide cautionary flags that identify potentially stressed or vulnerable watersheds and/or populations (e.g., RPA status assessment, Pacific Salmon Explorer). These approaches are useful for initial watershed or population prioritization. However, in most cases these approaches are limited in their ability to accurately describe the cumulative impact that multiple stressors can have on individuals and specific populations because they lack a mechanistic approach that can verify the complex interacting pathways of effects on fish (Peacock, Braun, Hodgson et al., 2023). This complexity makes it difficult to understand how future landscape alterations and climate change will affect salmon in a given watershed; thus limiting our ability to provide specific advice to managers on how to predict which mitigation or recovery actions (e.g. habitat restoration, harvest reductions) will most effectively recover salmon populations. We propose to link in situ ecophysiology information with other biophysical habitat monitoring data to develop mechanistic relationships that address management issues around habitat-population modeling, assessment of restoration function, and fish responses to climate change. The specific management questions are: Q1) What multi-factor stressors limit stage specific freshwater habitat distribution? Q2) What are the key drivers of stage-specific survival and growth for life-cycle modelling? Q3) What is the role of temperature in combination with other key factors in predicting climate change impacts on salmon growth and survival in a given habitat (e.g. lake, river, wetlands)? Q4) What are major habitat factors that affect salmon growth and survival to consider in planning and assessment of habitat mitigation, restoration, and offsetting effectiveness? The proposal is to execute a series of projects that directly address these management questions through two main outcomes 1) improved understanding of cumulative effects, and co-development of 2) tools and approaches to guide future mechanistic assessments of cumulative impacts. Improve Understanding: For year 1 & 2, we propose to continue work on cumulative impact projects: 1) development of in situ stage specific mechanistic relationships among biophysical factors (dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, flow, conspecific competition), distribution, physiological condition metrics, growth, and survival for juvenile salmonids – all measure in situ, 2) continue to develop and evaluate ecophysiology tools related to evaluating fish condition. Life-stage specific mechanistic relationships will be examined using samples in-hand from three large scale field programs (Lakes, E-Watch, North Thompson Salmon Ecosystem Program) within the Freshwater Ecosystems Section. All three programs generate unique multi-year population data on multiple biophysical factors influencing juvenile salmon condition, growth, and survival such as, water quality, conspecific density, temperature, food availability, primary productivity, DO and water level in lakes, wetlands, and flows in rivers. Models examining the effects of multiple biophysical factors on condition will be used to understand how interacting biophysical drivers (including stressors) shape fish condition, while models examining relationships between condition metrics and growth and/or survival will examine the use of condition metrics as tools to indicate future salmon presence, growth and survival. Concomitant lab work is ongoing to support the development of ecophysiology tools, such as growth hormones (IgF) for freshwater salmon growth, troponin for oxygen stress, and triglycerides (TAG) for nutritional status, that can be used as potential indicators of habitat quality. For Year 3&4 we will use the results from year 1&2 to identify and test key knowledge gaps on cumulative effects in salmon (e.g. Iacarella proposal). This selection of multifactor field experiments could include: low DO and high temperature; food availability, temperature, and growth/survival; pH and temperature tolerance experiments with preference/avoidance behaviour studies; and temperature and migratory stressors on in-river survival Sockeye/Chinook/Coho. This project is distinct from related PSSI proposals in that we are proposing a mechanistic approach to test the cumulative impact of multiple factors directly on individual fish response (i.e. growth, survival, stress) in their native habitats, leveraging multiple program expertise both within the freshwater section and beyond. Our experience is that science advice to major management decisions are best supported by a mechanistic understanding how environmental and physiological processes directly impact fish themselves. This is foundational work that can then be used to generate population responses were appropriate. However, we acknowledge that not all management questions to science require such an in-depth experimental approach, which is why we are proposing the guideline development to help managers and researchers prioritize how best to approach assessing cumulative impacts, as well as work with the other related projects. The proposal is complementary to other PSSI science proposals in that we are addressing similar questions, but at different spatial scales (e.g. Iacarella’s broad region-wide scale) and biological levels of organization. The work also complements broad-scale modeled predictions of discharge, temperature, and DO, that can be used with our mechanistic relationships to generate robust predictions of fish responses to climate change. More specifically, we will help test some of key stressor interactions that emerge as pervasive across the province from Iacarells’s proposal with field-based studies. We will directly link the outputs from Naman’s model of habitat suitability with direct measures of fish condition, fish performance and survival (i.e. a form of cross validation). We will work with Czembor’s group to share ideas on the state of knowledge of key limiting factors, and evaluate fit-chips as a potential ecophysiological tool from the Miller proposal. Tools and Approaches: We will synthesize approaches and our results to develop a pragmatic guide for initiating mechanistic cumulative effects investigations. We started with a literature review (Y1-2) of current methods for assessing physiological condition, as an integrated measure of habitat quality. The review will examine the benefits and limitations of these different physiological condition metrics and span metrics that include genomic, transcriptomic (fitchips), proteins (e.g. hormones, enzymes), metabolites (TAGs, ions), and phenotypes (size). This verification of physiological tools will be done in conjunction with assessing different habitat monitoring and modelling approaches (e.g. Cunningham 2022; Naman proposal) to verify Value of Information. For Year 3 & 4\. The culmination of the literature review and field/lab projects will be a pragmatic guide for a tiered approach (i.e. opinions, reviews, observations, hypothesis testing, quantification of uncertainty) to initiate mechanistic cumulative effects investigations that directly link to management advice (Patterson et al. 2016). The guide can be used to develop in-depth monitoring programs where watersheds or populations are flagged by broad scale analyses as stressed or at risk (Iacarella proposal).

Over the past year our 6PPD-quinone (6PPD-q) field program has been working to characterize the presence of the toxic tire derived chemical 6PPD-q at 32 sites in salmon bearing creeks in the greater Vancouver area, Squamish and Vancouver Island before, during, and after rain events. The sample collection has been carried out with help from World Fisheries Trust, Peninsula Streams Society, and the Musqueam, Tsleil-Waututh, Tsawwassen, and Cowichan First Nations. Preliminary data from the greater Vancouver area in 2022 showed significantly higher levels of 6PPD-q in creeks during rainfall events, with levels approaching or exceeding expected effects levels and lethality in coho salmon. The goal of the proposed project is to build on these findings by 1) collecting water samples at 10 new priority sites in salmon bearing creeks; 2) assessing 6PPD-quinone levels temporally before, during, and after a rain event at a reduced number of priority sites; 3) characterizing the removal of 6PPD-quinone from stormwater green infrastructure. This project will deliver new data on 6PPD-quinone levels in salmon bearing creeks in coastal British Columbia. This study will provide enabling information to PSSI and fisheries managers as they aim to curb historic declines in Pacific salmon, particularly coho salmon which are highly sensitive to this chemical, and enable their recovery.

The overall aim of the work described here is to characterize and rank contaminants of concern in WCVI juvenile Chinook salmon and assess contaminant-related health effects in WCVI juvenile Chinook salmon deemed to be of highest concern.

A recent contaminant assessment of six priority contaminant classes in 11 adult Chinook stocks revealed that WCVI Chinook had among the highest concentrations of the following contaminants: alkylphenols (APs), chlorinated paraffins (CPs), and two organochlorine pesticides (HCH, and DDT). The goal of the proposed project is to build on these findings by analyzing an additional suite of contaminants in WCVI juvenile salmon, with a particular focus on juvenile Chinook, in order to support a prioritization and ranking of contaminants of concern. This project will also deliver new data on WCVI Chinook habitat by analysing sediments and water to inform local land use practices and possible mitigation steps. Results will be compared to our contaminant characterization and prioritization that is underway in juvenile and adult Fraser River Chinook. This study will provide enabling information to PSSI and fisheries managers as they aim to curb historic declines in priority Pacific salmon stocks and enable their recovery.

Oceanographers in DFO and other departments such as ECCC have collaborated in the development of ocean models that can be used to assess future changes in the environment for salmon and other fish species. However, there is a significant 'scale gap' between the global, coarse resolution Earth System Models used to generate climate projections and the high-resolution (e.g., 3 km) models used to downscale these projections for coastal and shelf environments. This gap can be filled by basin-scale models at 1/12 to 1/4 degree. The present research plans to build on existing efforts funded under CSRF to conduct simulations of projected future climates at these intermediate scales. In this way we will create an 'envelope of possibilities' of future environments for salmon in the oceanic environment.

The main anticipated outcomes from this work are (1) development of a capacity to downscale climate projections at intermediate scale, including biogeochemistry (e.g., oxygen concentration), and (2) generation of data products that can used for Species Distribution Modelling of salmon in the oceanic environment.

These data are critical for managers to best allocate limited resources, focusing recovery efforts on salmon populations best aligned with future salmon production and diversity. Climate change already affects Canadian Pacific salmon and their ecosystems, with impacts expected to accelerate.

Climate change vulnerability assessments (CCVAs) are important tools to support management decisions, providing summaries of the relative threat level for a population from climate change. These assessments integrate expert knowledge on salmon, their ecosystems, and climate change projections, and have been successfully applied to U.S. Pacific salmon populations, but are currently lacking for Canadian Pacific salmon.

We will apply the U.S. CCVA framework to Canadian Pacific salmon. These assessments will be conducted for two groups of salmon populations to provide a toolkit for conducting salmon CCVA’s for the 377 Conservation Units (CUs) of salmon DFO manages across all five species (Sockeye, Chinook, Coho, Pink and Chum). These two case studies will include CUs with the greatest risk of extinction, since these CUs will urgently require climate vulnerability information to support management decisions.

2025-2026,2572,Assessing Salinity Alteration of Nursery Conditions for Salmon Smolts following Construction of Roberts Bank Terminal-2,PSSI (B-base),Aquatic Animal Health,Terri Sutherland,Submitted,"Millions of Fraser River salmon rely on Roberts Bank tidal flats for food, shelter, and salinity acclimatization before they undergo a multi-year migration across the Pacific Ocean for many years. Since harpacticoids provide a link between primary production (benthic diatom biofilms) and tertiary production at higher trophic levels (salmon-smolts, sandpipers), harpacticoids can transfer diatom-derived a high-quality food consisting of long-chain polysaccharide unsaturated fatty-acids (LC-PUFAs) that serve as a high-quality migration fuel for salmon smolts. However, modelling scenarios of salinity estimates on Roberts Bank shows a salinity regime shift towards freshwater 34% relative to that of the existing tidal flats conditions between pre- and post-construction of Roberts Bank Terminal-2 (RBT2). On Roberts Bank, the alignment of diatom-harpacticoid-salmon trophic levels and transfer of LC-PUFAs across trophic levels must be sustained to avoid a potential “match–mismatch” scenario (McKinnell and Irvine, 2021). This timely pairing of predator and prey is also crucial for 1.5 million Western sandpipers (Caldris mauri), that migrate between Panama to Alaska annually (April 15 – May 15) and stopover on Roberts Bank tidal flats. Western sandpipers also rely on diatom biofilms (LC-PUFAs) for fuel for the long migration to Alaska (Warnock and Bishop, 1998; Elner et al, 2005; Kuwae et al. 2008; Mathot et al. 2010). Given the overlap of 1) migration stopover location and timing for both salmon and sandpipers on Roberts Bank; and 2) similar prey preferences (benthic diatom biofilms) and required LC-PUFAs for migration fuel, a competitive interaction may occur under these circumstances, leading to a match-mismatch scenario for both benthic diatom predators. Furthermore, the predicted reduction of salinity due to RBT2 construction during the season of freshet and migration stopovers of both salmon and sandpiper, may apply a significant environmental stressor to this competition for high-quality food.

2025-2026,3104,Establishing a feed assessment program in Pacific salmon enhancement hatcheries,PSSI (B-base),Hatchery Science,"Ian Forster, Erika Eliason",Approved,"Fish feed is critically important to fish growth, physiological functioning and fish health, and a major budget item for salmonid enhancement facilities in BC (~ overall 1 million CAD/year). Feed is a perishable item, however. The quality will change if feed is exposed to air, adverse conditions, or prolonged storage time. Ingredients including proteins, lipids, vitamins, and pigments are heat- and moisture-sensitive. Feed can degrade and become conducive to mold growth when exposed to extended periods of high temperature and/or humid conditions. Moreover, there has been significant refinement in fish feed formulations to partially replace finite and expensive marine ingredients, such as fish meal and fish oil, with less costly, possibly more sustainable, and more stable supplies of terrestrial ingredients; these may not necessarily be suitable for growing fish for enhancement purpose (Colombo and Turchini 2021). The quality of marine ingredients also fluctuates with the increasingly unpredictable ocean conditions. These, and other, uncertainties highlight the need to establish a feed sampling program to verify feed quality and relay potential concerns to suppliers such that rapid improvements can be made.

In the past, SEP collaborated with the DFO Fish Nutrition Lab (then under Dr. David Higgs), located in West Vancouver. Dr. Higgs was an expert in understanding nutritionally related fish mortality events. As an example, he was involved in identifying the role of zinc deficiency on Chinook cataract development (Richardson et al. 1985). His laboratory was also instrumental in providing feed quality assessments through the 1990’s and early 2000’s and the analytical support program for assessing SEP’s feed supplies at West Vancouver Laboratory (now the Pacific Science Enterprise Centre, PSEC) ended with Dr. Higgs’ retirement, close to two decades ago. In contrast, the US Fish and Wildlife Service agency (Abernathy Fish Technology Center) examines fish feed received by enhancement hatcheries located in the US Pacific Regions and generates a quarterly report by probing into feed proximate composition (protein, fat, ash, moisture) and rancidity related parameters (peroxide value, free fatty acids, thiobarbituric acid). It is not uncommon that the results show deviations in fat and protein contents and elevated rancidity levels (oil degradation) relative to the manufacturer ingredient label and quality standard (i.e. Fish feed quality control report 2024). The goal here is to establish a feed sampling program to provide advice (feed quality/storage) for salmon enhancement facilities in BC, and communicate the results internally and externally, and to assess the viability of a long-term feed quality assessment program.

2025-2026,3107,Scenario Planning: improving the adaptability of Pacific salmon hatchery planning and implementation to current and future climate changes,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Modelling & Decision Support,"Sue Grant, Bronwyn MacDonald, Lenora Turcotte, David Willis",Submitted,"The problem: Climate change is creating a more volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world. How do hatchery managers move forward despite these uncertainties and overcome “management paralysis” in the context of climate change?

What is being proposed: We will use scenario planning to develop insight into how SEP/DFO can better ensure that hatchery planning and implementation is adaptable to climate change impacts over the next 20 years. Year 1 will focus on a DFO internal process and plan for broader engagement in Year 2 with Indigenous knowledge experts.

Scenario planning enables organizations to embrace uncertainty by expanding their understanding of the plausible range of futures they may experience. Scenarios are meant to guide and inform organizations about potential future changes that will impact how they operate. These processes enable organizations to be better positioned to deal with unexpected threats, and take advantage of unexpected opportunities.

Scenario planning is a structured approach for defining plausible futures. This is a co-learning participatory process, that has been identified as a key way to advance climate adaptation within organizations and processes (Hare 2020). Expertise provided by DFO Science, SEP, Indigenous groups, and other Sectors will be integrated through this process.

Scenario planning identifies areas of high impact and low predictability within a system, and imagines future situations, termed scenarios, that could occur given the uncertainties identified. Large-scale driving forces that may push the future in different directions are identified and used to uncover potential future states. Scenarios provide a fresh perspective, and a new framework that can be used to encourage dialogue and strategic thinking on the challenges and opportunities we may face. It is a powerful tool for forcing us to challenge commonly-held assumptions and expectations, and abandon previously fixed ideas that may no longer hold true. Scenarios help by legitimizing a dialogue, challenging conventional wisdom, initiating widespread discussion, and creating the possibility of genuine transformation.

Participants in scenario planning processes identify and evaluate management options or adaptations that are robust to alternate plausible future scenarios. In this way, scenario planning can help managers understand where management strategies may need to change to prepare for the future. This work can also prioritize knowledge gaps and future science priorities.

Scenario planning is a flexible process that can be tailored to the specific project goals and objectives. Generally, processes follow five steps described by Frens and Morrison (2020): 1\. Orientation to the problem: define the specific issue being discussed, goals, scope, and desired outcomes. 2\. Exploration: improve understanding of the issue, identify key drivers and uncertainties. 3\. Scenario building: identify critical uncertainties (drivers) for the scenario framework, develop plausible scenario narratives. 4\. Application: examine scenarios for implications, develop and evaluate management actions. 5\. Identify indicators: specifically, environmental indicators and thresholds that would trigger recommended management strategies.

2025-2026,3118,Assessing the impact of modifications to hatchery release strategies of Chinook salmon on their distribution and marine survival.,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Chrys Neville,Reviewed,"The Salmon Marine Interaction Program has been conducting large scale marine surveys of juvenile Pacific salmon in the Strait of Georgia for the past 25 years. The large geographic range of the surveys, surveys conducted in both early summer and fall, and the use of an unbiased sampling gear (trawl net), has allowed the surveys to examine specific stocks of Pacific salmon during their first marine summer and design studies to test hypothesis on factors regulating the survival during their marine residence. During this period of time the Program has worked collaboratively with SEP hatcheries on a number of questions associated with differences in hatchery and wild marine survival and based on preliminary results, possible strategies for increasing marine success of hatchery fish. This study is to complete the analysis, interpretation and reporting of two specific studies associated with Chinook Salmon that were initiated over the past six year but require completion of laboratory analysis for results and interpretations to be available to managers and other researchers.

Big Qualicum Hatchery (BQH) Chinook late release strategy. Collaboration and discussions between emeritus scientist Dr. Richard Beamish and SEP was the basis for the initiation of the experimental late release strategy of Chinook Salmon and Coho Salmon from a number of ECVI hatcheries. Although there was increased survival by the late release group for both species, this variable release was only continued for Chinook Salmon. Several hypothesis for the success of the late release groups were proposed including both top down and bottom up mechanisms, however, these hypothesis were not tested. The SMI Program initiated a study to test the bottom up hypothesis. Specifically, the hypothesis suggested that the late release fish had increased and rapid early marine growth that resulted in a shift in metabolism in mid-summer from growth to energy storage. This change in metabolism would result in higher condition of these fish entering their first marine winter and higher subsequent survival. These faster growing fish, would therefore, represent a larger proportion of adult returns. To complete this study, juvenile salmon were collected in the early summer and fall surveys and identified to BQR using a combination of CWT recoveries and DNA analysis. The shift to specific brood groups for the different release timing groups and PBT genetic analysis has allowed release specific groups to be identified in the past few years and has significantly increased the number of samples available for our analysis. Scales and otoliths are collected from the fish for examination of growth rates and muscle tissue is used to measure energy density using bomb calorimetry. Additionally, adult returns are sampled to examine the early marine growth of these survivors compared to the previously collected juveniles. The funding requested for this study will ensure completion of the bomb calorimetry analysis and interpretation for this study.

Increased Chinook Releases from Lower Fraser River (LFR). In 2019, hatcheries on the LFR increased releases with the expected outcome of providing additional Chinook Salmon to southern resident killer whales. The early marine distribution of these LFR Chinook salmon through their first marine summer is in the southern portion of the Strait of Georgia including both Canadian and US waters. The “footprint” of this stock directly overlaps with the distribution of Chinook Salmon originating from Puget Sound, an area that was also increasing releases of hatchery reared Chinook salmon. For the LFR stocks, there is no evidence of any large scale migration out of the Strait of Georgia prior to the fall. Due to the coverage of the SMI surveys in both Canadian and US waters and Juan de Fuca, this samples collected in the SMI surveys provide an ability to examine the impact of the increased releases and identify changes in abundance, distribution or condition. If the BQR study support the hypothesis that growth during this period is associated with total marine survival, any impact on the early marine growth of LFR Chinook Salmon through competition could impact total marine survival. Examination of juveniles from these stocks collected both prior to and after the increased releases will help interpret if the increased density had an adverse effect on their early marine growth and survival or if there was increased competition with other stocks due to changes in distribution.

Specifically, this study is requesting funding for an EG-02 technician (6 months) and a BI-02 biologist (10 months) to assist with completion of laboratory analysis and with the analysis and interpretation of results for publication. The technician will complete the energy density analysis of juvenile Chinook salmon from the fall 2017-2023 SMI surveys for both BQR and LFR Chinook stocks. The technician will also collect biological samples (otoliths and scales) from adult returning Chinook salmon in the fall of 2024 (BQR). The biologist will conduct spatial analysis by stock group for Chinook Salmon caught in the surveys between 2010 and 2023. The data analysis will include spatial analysis by stock group for juvenile Chinook Salmon caught in surveys between 2010 and 2023. Additionally, they will co-author primary publications associated with the two projects. It is anticipated that a subsample of otoliths will need to be analyzed to validate measurements on early marine growth estimated from scale patterns. This work would be done by experts in Alaska that routinely do this work for fish caught in their marine surveys.

2025-2026,3187,Developing a geospatial BC Cumulative Effects – Life Cycle Model Assessment for focal salmon populations to estimate viability under changing climate conditions and multiple anthropogenic stressors,PSSI (B-base),,Josephine Iacarella,Submitted,"This project will address the following line items from SEP priority concepts: • How should hatchery efforts be prioritized to ensure viability of salmon populations most affected by climate change (warming conditions, drought) and multiple anthropogenic stressors (industry, urbanization, etc.)? • Which enhanced salmon populations are most vulnerable to climate change? • Are there streams in BC where climate change has resulted in habitat that may no longer be able to sustain wild salmon populations? • Develop and/or use tools to assess climate vulnerability and evaluate possible mitigation actions. Develop a BC Climate Vulnerability Assessment Tool that measures species' vulnerability to climate change and assists in making decisions about how to protect them.

The proposed project will refine and extend an existing multi-threat assessment on fish and fish habitat conducted for the stream network of the Fraser River Basin to a cumulative effects and life cycle modeling assessment for focal SEP salmon stocks. The overarching objective is to produce estimates of salmon productivity and capacity across relevant stream reaches based on multiple climate scenarios and timeframes to help inform enhancement strategies and potential management and mitigation actions. Results of the proposed research will help identify where specific salmon populations are experiencing threats detrimental to their viability along their freshwater distribution, which threats are estimated to be most limiting to populations, and how this varies under different climate change scenarios and timeframes.

Estimates of fish and fish habitat exposure to 13 threats identified as important by FFHPP and COSEWIC were recently developed by the Freshwater Spatial Ecology Program for the Fraser River Basin (Iacarella et al., approved in CSAS peer-review meeting February 2024). These include anthropogenic activity and landscape disturbance-based threats of Aquatic Invasive Species, riparian disturbance, longitudinal fragmentation (barriers to upstream/downstream passage), latitudinal fragmentation (barriers to floodplains), in stream habitat destruction, flow alteration, human-derived sedimentation, human-derived nutrients, and pollution, and climate change-based threats of high stream flow, low stream flow, flood risk, and high stream temperature. This large-scale geospatial product represents the most comprehensive threat assessment for BC’s freshwater fish habitat to-date, using an extensive suite of best available data and methodologies. The threat scores from the assessment were summarized as additive cumulative threats as a first step.

We propose to select salmon stocks within the Fraser River Basin that are of interest to SEP to refine and apply these quantified threat exposures in a cumulative effects – life cycle modeling framework that has recently been developed for BC, called the Cumulative Effects Model for Prioritizing Recovery Actions (CEMPRA; Bayly et al. 2023). This framework is an advancement of the ‘Joe model’ originally developed to assess cumulative effects on trout populations in Alberta (MacPherson, et al. 2020; MacPherson et al. 2024). The model uses exposure estimates and a combination of literature review and expert elicitation to derive stressor-response curves specific to life history stages of salmon. The spatially explicit exposures and predicted salmon responses are then fed into a life cycle model to produce estimates of productivity and capacity of the system (Bayly et al. 2023). Response curves and life cycle model parameters are generally produced in expert workshops, and an extensive literature review is underway to compile a comprehensive library of response curves for salmon (J. Moore Lab, SFU). The CEMPRA framework further enables scenario testing of how varying levels of threats, such as different climate change projections or sediment loadings, influence productivity and capacity estimates. The results of CEMPRA are particularly useful to make relative comparisons of which salmon stocks and associated streams may be experiencing the highest impacts currently and under future climate conditions.

The proposed work will address the following key objectives for a suite of SEP-identified focal stocks in the Fraser River Basin: 1\. Refine and apply threat exposures developed for the Fraser River Basin for specific application to focal stocks and CEMPRA modeling. 2\. Develop and apply stressor-response curves using threats from Objective 1 and salmon responses derived from available literature reviews and through expert elicitation workshops. 3\. Use CEMPRA to develop cumulative effect scores and apply life cycle models to derive productivity and capacity estimates across relevant stream reaches using stock specific information from available DFO data and expert elicitation workshops. 4\. Explore climate change vulnerability and test scenarios using different climate projections and timeframes, as well as different levels of human activity based threats to inform SEP enhancement strategies and potential management and mitigation actions. 5\. Conduct sensitivity analysis of model inputs to inform uncertainty levels. 6\. Develop maps and figures comparing vulnerability across stocks based on threats and climate change scenarios.

This project will further serve as a template for developing similar products for other stocks in the Fraser River Basin and extending the assessment to other basins in BC.

2025-2026,3188,Characterizing the ecology of watersheds slated for supplementation by conservation hatcheries,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Region Functional Group,"Kristi Saunders, David Patterson, Arthur Bass",Not Approved,"  1. Overview PROBLEMS: Pathogen introductions from natural sourced water coming into hatcheries may pose future risk to Stocks of Concern to be supplemented by Conservation Hatcheries: Source water used to culture salmon varies considerably between hatcheries. Some hatcheries have “well” ground water, as well as “natural” stream/river/lake water, sometimes at different depths of the lakes. Water source selection at different life stages will depend on operational considerations unique to each hatchery and production cycle. Hatchery managers are acutely aware that with the natural sourced water, which often comes from systems used by multiple species of salmon and trout, they could be introducing pathogens into their hatcheries every time they change water sources. With the new PSSI “Proactive, modernized, holistic approach to ensure optimal health and condition of Hatchery Production” project, in addition to monitoring hatchery cohorts over the course of production, we were asked by hatchery managers to monitor salmon pathogens in their source water. What we found was that source water was a major contributor to both the infectious health of cultured salmon, but also their susceptibility to stress. What is also clear is that once a pathogen enters a hatchery, under present husbandry practices, it is “everywhere”. It has been argued that because the pathogens being introduced into the hatcheries come from the local natural system, exposure is “natural” for local stocks being cultured for enhancement, and releasing infected fish may not have strong consequences on local wild stocks. However, this same argument cannot be made for Conservation hatcheries, where stocks from distal watersheds are to be produced under a single hatchery umbrella, and then transported to supplement watersheds where wild stocks are no longer able to sustain themselves. With the increased reliance on conservation hatcheries, it is imperative to better understanding these risks in order to derive appropriate mitigation measures.  
We propose to develop general baseline metrics of the current status of freshwater ecosystem health for systems slated for future Conservation-based supplementation: As we move towards hatchery supplementation for stocks of concern across a broad reach of watersheds, it has become clear from recent CSAS processes (e.g. Chinook RPAs) that our understanding of watersheds with CUs of conservation concern are often data poor with respect to biodiversity metrics. Many smaller systems are lacking or have imprecise estimates of spawner escapement and limited information on the relevant salmon ecosystems metrics that impact the sustainability of those habitats to support salmon. We are often unable to answer basic ecological questions about salmon freshwater ecosystems, such as: Is there an adequate prey field and does that match the distribution of juvenile salmon? Are there key predators in the system? Are there competitor species that impact the carrying capacity of the system? What pathogens are found, and which do we expect to become more impactful under climate change? We can begin to address these questions with eDNA.  
PROPOSAL: Objective 1: Characterize the state of salmon freshwater ecosystems where stocks of concern are currently enhanced and document changes in biodiversity following hatchery releases. Filtered water samples will be collected from selected locations downstream of spawning grounds and release sites: 1) prior to adult returns (if applicable), 2) during peak spawning (if applicable), 3) immediately prior to juvenile release, and 4) 2-4 weeks after release. eDNA metabarcoding would be applied to characterize salmon/trout distributions within the watersheds, and the distributions of their predators, prey, and competitors. High throughput qPCR monitoring of eDNA/RNA would be applied to salmon and pathogens. qPCR provides a more quantitative measure of relative “abundance” than is available with metabarcoding, which is why we would run salmon with both methods. The number of watersheds and spatiotemporal granularity of sampling could be varied depending on funding. Different watersheds could be monitored in the two years, with the potential to monitor watersheds that are not yet receiving hatchery supplementation solely for the purpose of characterizing the system prior to supplementation. Objective 2: Monitor the microbiome of hatchery conservation populations and how it changes throughout the course of rearing. Using the same technologies identified in Objective 1, we will characterize the pathogen profiles of multiple conservation stocks reared at a single hatchery by sampling: 1) during egg incubation, 2) at regular intervals (1-3 months depending upon production cycle) throughout rearing, and 3) prior to release. Ideally, these populations would match with the watersheds identified in Objective 1. This will provide visualization of the differences in pathogen profiles between populations as they enter the hatchery and how these change among populations throughout rearing. As previous work has demonstrated the apparent importance of rearing water source in pathogen profiles, we will sample the hatchery source waters at each visit. We will also sample the hatchery outflow to determine whether pathogens that enter with broodstock are similar to those detected in the hatchery source water and surroundings.  
For both objectives, we would consider year one to be a “proof of concept”. The scale of the project would be smaller to allow for determination of the scope (site and sample replication) required to characterize a watershed. Lessons learned from year one will facilitate efficient scaling up in year two.

  2. Species, Stock, and Geographic Region: In year two the project would be focused on the Middle and Upper Fraser Watershed, where a conservation hatchery is projected to be established in the next few years to support multiple species and populations. While the initial work could be focused on Fraser Chinook (Spring and Summer 5.2), the sampling protocol is highly flexible and could accommodate investigations into any species or populations of interest and include the following. a. Geographic Area: Fraser Watershed b. Species: Sockeye, Coho, Chinook, Pink, Chum (plus other organisms) c. Salmon Management Unit/Conservation Unit: Pacific Region d. Life Stage: egg, fry, parr, smolt and Adult

In year one, during the proof of concept, we may request to work in watersheds closer to the Vancouver area or on Vancouver Island to facilitate rapid sample processing and more flexibility in methodology and sample timing.

  1. Project Linkages:  
This project will link with the PSSU-SEP project “Proactive, modernized, holistic approach to ensure optimal health and condition of Hatchery Production”, which includes eDNA samples collected in and around hatcheries on Vancouver Island. Data will be compatible for broader, regional comparisons. This project will also link with PSSI Salmon Ecosystem project to D. Patterson on “Improved understanding of cumulative impacts on salmon survival across freshwater life-stages; tools and approaches for mechanistic assessments.”

  2. External Partnerships: We hope to work with researchers from UNBC and SFU. Local First Nations engagement will depend on which specific watersheds are selected. 

  3. Reporting: Annual reports will be produced to document the work that has been done to date and available results. If hatcheries are interested in receiving updates on pathogens detected in cultured populations or source water we can provide additional reporting. We anticipate preparing and submitting a manuscript for peer review. Importantly, the project will also provide a map of relative abundance of detections of juvenile salmon within their freshwater ecosystems, and models that can relate salmon distributions with distributions of prey, predators, pathogens, and competitors. These biological relationships can be contrasted across freshwater ecosystems with high salmon productivity and those where salmon are currently threatened to better understand the biological factors that may undermine ecosystem carrying capacities and recovery. 

  4. Data Products: The datasets on species-specific eDNA results will be stored and secured on established existing Genomics databases within the Molecular Genetics Section, they will be readily shared with SEP, and in due time made publicly available through publication and DFO open data portals. Epicollect will be used for all field collections for seamless integration of field metadata into the existing database.

Here surface temperature and salinity data have been collected daily during the high tide. These data are used by dozens of fisheries scientists, oceanographers, and modelers throughout the world. Data have been collected using different methods as technology progressed, from manual thermometers and bottled salinity samples to data collected by handheld sensors. Despite these different methods and the importance of the time series, the data haven't systematically been examined to understand how the different sampling methods could have added bias to the data.

2025-2026,3573,Cultus Bass,PSSI (B-base),Freshwater Habitat Research,"Scott Decker, Daniel Doutaz, Sean Everitt, Chad Ridley, Emily Breiteneder",Submitted,"Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), a piscivorous fish species native to eastern North America, have been introduced into Cultus Lake, British Columbia. Cultus Lake is home to endangered sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) as well as endemic Cultus pygmy sculpin (Cottus aleuticus). Smallmouth bass introduced in other salmon-bearing habitat have been observed to exert substantial mortality on salmon fry and smolts, suggesting a similar impact may be possible in Cultus Lake. Observations of sockeye salmon, and Cultus pygmy sculpin in the diet of captured smallmouth bass demonstrates predation upon two native species at risk. While smallmouth bass represent a threat to the Cultus Lake native fish community and species at risk specifically, they are also highly valued by some anglers. Importantly, as a source population, they also represent a real and present threat to other ecosystems in the Lower Mainland. Smallmouth bass are often found in streams and rivers; in fact, they have already been found downstream of Cultus Lake. Additionally, there is the threat of anglers moving smallmouth bass to other waterbodies in the Lower Mainland to create new bass fisheries, which themselves would create risk to receiving environments. While there are largemouth bass (M. salmoides) populations in various waterbodies throughout the Lower Mainland, this is the first verified smallmouth bass population, and has drawn a lot of attention from the angling community. Early work on this population has identified a divergence of public opinions: some value native species (especially sockeye salmon) and want to see bass suppressed; other values angling opportunities for smallmouth bass and will strongly oppose any measures to affect this valued fishery resource.

There are two issues that this project will address: (1) understanding which suppression options will result in the lowest opposition from anglers and community members, thereby identifying the risk of unintended consequences (e.g., additional transfers to other lakes); and (2) determining the suppression strategy (combination of different suppression options) which will best inform estimates of effectiveness for each suppression option so as to maximize effective suppression moving forward to reduce impacts on sockeye salmon recruitment.

In year one of this project, an electrofishing boat will be used to capture smallmouth bass, and all bass will be tagged with passive integrated transponders (PIT tags). These PIT-tagged fish will help determine the initial population size (through mark-recapture methods) and provide a baseline for future smallmouth bass suppression efforts. A subset of smallmouth bass will also be tagged using acoustic transmitters (n=25; Vemco V9 & V13 acoustic tags) to track their movements within the Cultus Lake system, and to determine if any emigration out of the system is occurring.

The smallmouth bass fishery will be monitored to assess total fishing effort (using standard access point creel survey procedures), harvest rates, harvest size, and catch rates (total number fish released + harvested). All harvested bass reported by anglers will be measured, weighted, scanned for PIT tags, and have scales removed for later aging. Additionally, as part of the catch monitoring program anglers will be surveyed to determine their level of satisfaction with their bass catch rates and size, native fish catch rates and their opinions on the different suppression options considered. These survey answers will allow for changes in utility and attitudes to be tracked over time.

Lastly, nest destruction and removal of male bass guarding nests is to occur once spawning begins in the spring. Bass activity in the spring should be monitored frequently to identify the start of spawning season. Once nests are constructed, a survey of known spawning locations should occur to identify nests for destruction. Captured males will be measured, weighed, have sex and maturity status confirmed, scanned for PIT tags, and have scales and/or otoliths removed for aging.

This project was developed in partnership between Simon Fraser University, the Province of BC, and the DFO. Please see the attached ""Cultus Lake Smallmouth Bass Suppression Plan.pdf"" in the ""Supporting Resources"" section for additional information on subsequent years of this project.

2025-2026,3596,Exploring the contribution of hatchery strays to wild Chinook Salmon returns on the West Coast of Vancouver Island.,PSSI (B-base),Pacific Salmon Population Monitoring,Diana McHugh,Submitted,"Chinook Salmon from hatcheries on the West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) comprise a significant component of the overall return to this region. The Robertson Creek and Conuma River hatcheries each release several million juvenile Chinook Salmon annually, and have seen combined returns in excess of 200,000 in recent years. Salmon generally return to their natal streams, but a portion of each years adults will stray to nearby watersheds. Some hatchery release strategies (e.g. netpens) may increase the likelihood of straying, and generally high rates of straying to otherwise wild streams have been linked to nearby netpen operations. In one instance, up to 50% of the Chinook Salmon returning to the Tahsish River originated from the Conuma River.

Salmon returning to rivers across the WCVI are uniquely adapted to their environments, and these unique adaptations increase their fitness against the obstacles they will face as they complete their life cycles. Introduction of strays that lack these local adaptations will yield poor results for the strays, but there is also potential for interbreeding with natal populations, potentially reducing fitness of the recipient population as maladaptive traits are incorporated. It is therefore important to understand the magnitude of straying, and develop methods of mitigating high levels of straying when they occur.

We propose to sample post-spawn Chinook Salmon in streams on the West Coast of Vancouver Island. Collections of scales, tissue samples and otoliths will allow us to identify the origin of these Chinook Salmon and potentially adjust hatchery operations (e.g. netpen locations, release timing) if certain hatchery strategies are contributing disproportionately to straying behaviour.

In British Columbia (BC), many salmon stocks have been assessed as at-risk by COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada), but while climate change has been increasingly considered in salmon management and policy, the threat posed by AIS has largely been ignored. Further, stressors like increasing global temperatures are out of the control of regional management while AIS can be managed locally. By targeting AIS most likely to have the biggest impact on salmon survival or productivity, we can improve salmon recovery by reducing the stress that these invasive species cause. AIS impacts on salmon are well documented in the US Pacific Northwest where, for example, invasive Walleye consume up to 2 million smolts a year in the Columbia River (Sanderson et al. 2009). The expansion of Northern Pike in Alaska has led to the decline of salmon productivity in some regions and all five salmon species have been classified as highly vulnerable to pike invasion in at least part of their Alaskan range (Jalbert et al. 2021). Habitat alteration can also impact salmon: Schwoerer et al. (2019) estimated the potential for $159 million annual damage to the Alaskan Sockeye salmon industry from one invasive plant species, Elodea. However, the extent and relative impact of freshwater AIS threats to salmon habitat and productivity have yet to be assessed in BC. Here we will fill this gap.
