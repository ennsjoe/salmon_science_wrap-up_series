Habitat issues in these watersheds are linked to excess sediment delivery resulting from forest harvesting activities and associated road-building.  This has resulted in the infilling of holding pools and estuarine tidal channels and in some cases cutting off upstream connections to freshwater.  This issue was particularly devasting in the fall of 2022 when stage 5 drought occurred during the month of October indicating an urgent need to restore this habitat.  The project aims to address the issues of channel connectivity, availability of low salt marsh habitats and loss of holding pools by:  improving salmon access to existing spawning and nursery habitats, rehabilitating damaged estuarine nursery habitats and restoring cool water holding pools for migrating salmon.

These estuarine systems provide critical nearshore habitats for salmonids in the Salish Sea bioregion and needed habitat connectivity between the large estuaries of the Salish Sea.This will allow us to refine the recommendations in the DRAFT Restoration and Conservation Action Strategy Plan also formulated as part of Phase One and will set up community and First Nations-led restoration and conservation efforts anticipated to be undertaken in Phase Three.","Pacific Salmon Foundation (PSF)

While abundant salmon populations once provided annual sustenance to the Wet’suwet’en people, such abundance and diversity has largely eroded over the last several decades to the point of no longer fulfilling our community’s needs. There is an urgent need to restore our lands and waters that have been degraded due to logging, road building, agriculture, highway, railway, and urban development, and to rebuild our salmon populations to a level of abundance that can sustain our annual food needs and provide for the surrounding biological community. We will accomplish this through a multi-pronged approach that partners with academics, local environmental organizations, First Nation, government, and watershed groups to undertake activities recently deemed of high priority. Broadly, these include: engaging with local land users to stabilize streambanks and rebuild riparian structure in the most degraded habitats, develop robust rebuilding plans for culturally important and highly diminished species and populations, and improve monitoring data for such populations to assess effectiveness of ongoing habitat restoration and rebuilding efforts.","A Rocha

TDC may already be a factor in BC Chinook declines, and is expected to be a burgeoning issue under climate change. Thiamine is derived from prey in the marine environment and levels in predators vary in response to changing ocean conditions and diet. This project will provide baseline knowledge of the status of thiamine in BC Chinook salmon by: 1) determining thiamine levels in eggs and river entry fish from populations representative of life history types; 2) establishing the thiamine attributes of Chinook prey species; and 3) evaluating links between thiamine status of Chinook and mechanisms of TDC. This project will identify populations experiencing or at risk of TDC, guide realistic mitigation strategies in hatcheries, and inform prediction of future change.","Bon Chovy Fishing Charters

We will use PIT-tagging to estimate survival, and combine these estimates with individual-based measures of environmental stress using cutting-edge gene-expression tools (“Fit-Chips”). Additionally, we will monitor environmental DNA (eDNA) to determine key rearing habitats, availability of prey, and presence of predators and pathogens across spatial and temporal scales.

Our project will fill key information gaps pertaining to at-risk Chinook populations, prescribed for rebuilding under the Fisheries Act. Ultimately, the findings will help to inform targeted habitat restoration, protection, and enhancement efforts for WCVI Chinook salmon. Adding to ongoing collaborations with WCVI First Nations, DFO, local NGOs, and PSF’s Salmon Bottlenecks project, we will leverage extensive experience, expertise, and infrastructure already in place to deliver the most comprehensive investigation to date of early marine survival in WCVI Chinook salmon.","Pacific Salmon Foundation
